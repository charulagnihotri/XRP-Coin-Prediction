If you go onto the XRP/USDT pairing on LAToken and scroll back to the 23rd February you can see the price dropped to 0.00004USDT per XRP. I had placed very low limit orders prior to this that have since been filled.

When I logged into my account after placing these low bids on the market a while back, I was amazed to see I had amassed 632,151 XRP tokens.

Here’s the heart-breaking bit. I naturally was mind-blown, so I tried to sell some of the XRP in the account then withdraw my profits from the exchange elsewhere, only to have the withdrawal declined and my account temporarily closed for 1 day siting a ‘violation of our terms of use’. I have done nothing wrong and simply set low limit orders that were filled.

I contacted support asking why this has happened, they didn’t tell me why my account was restricted or what terms of use I had broken.

1666,1668710346.0,2022-11-17,"Binance is not holding verifiable proof of reserves for ETH/XRP in the BNB ecosystem and is failing to hold adequate reserves / or show reserves for most of its other cryptos. They only verify that they hold 30% of the ADA in the BNB ecosystem. Please also check the edit at the bottom for an update regarding lack of proof of reserves on the stables on BNB as well:

**TLDR:** Binance fails to provide adequate proof of reserves for assets in the BNB chain. Binance encourages users to withdraw their crypto into the Binance ecosystem by charging higher fees to withdraw into native ecosystems - and are failing to Provide Proof of Assets altogether or a sufficient amount in their Proof of Assets for the crypto in the Binance ecosystem. This gives Binance a huge opportunity to manipulate the crypto market by creating ""fake crypto tokens"" in the BNB ecosystem that are not backed by any underlying asset and then selling/using your assets. Furthermore, it pushes volume into BNB chain by encouraging withdraws into the BNB ecosystem that may end up not backed by any assets....

**What you need to know**

* [BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2 tokens) and BNB Smart Chain (BEP20 tokens) are two native chains of the Binance ecosystem](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/854415cf3d214371a7b60cf01ead0918). Binance allows users to withdraw lots of different crypto as tokens into their native chains which then allows users the ability to use ""those assets"" in the Binance ecosystem.
* As you can imagine, this could create a few concerns... The largest being Binance could sell/send the underlying asset of the BEP2/20 Tokens as the user no longer holds the true crypto but a token on the Binance ecosystem, essentially allowing them to manipulate the total supply of those cryptos by creating ""fake BNB tokens"" with no actual backing on the native chain.
* To ease concerns about artificial manipulation Binance began providing [Proof of Asset](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof) wallets where, for crosschain assets (Ether, XRP, ADA, Doge, etc..) they should theoretically hold an underlying asset equal to the amount of the asset that is in the BEP2/20 ecosystem. This is supposed to ensure the Binance asset you are holding is backed by an equal amount on its native chain and the supply is not being artificially manipulated.
   * The problem however is they do not provide a Proof of Asset list for most of their assets in the Binance ecosystem. Additionally of those that have a Proof of Asset wallet, most are not fully backed or actually list no real backing at all.
      * The [LTC proof of reserve address](https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/MQSs17ECe51kqhkFPQY98wiyPvGuK5iCB6) holds 745K LTC. However there are 857k LTC in the BNB ecosystem - 725k in the [BEP20 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x4338665cbb7b2485a8855a139b75d5e34ab0db94) and 132k in the [BEP2 addresses](https://explorer.bnbchain.org/asset/LTC-F07) \-  **87% backed**
      * THE [ADA proof of reserve](https://explorer.cardano.org/en/address?address=addr1q8hsff3uwtphx7dtya7unjwjwug52e5jvqp09je6pwqx8k4jvuxrw2x5rr7e258a33yzkrhhlrrc5ezvd2z7qtdq0gasme44c9) address holds 200M ADA. However there are 672M ADA in the BNB ecosystem - 241M circulating in [BEP20 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47) and 431M circulating in [BEP2 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47) \- **29.7% backed**
      * (very concerning) The following is the [listed](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof) proof of asset address [for ETHER](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9BF4001d307dFd62B26A2F1307ee0C0307632d59). It's supposed to hold all of the ETHER on the BNB ecosystem but it currently sits at .017 ETH and the ETHER was moved to [this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf977814e90da44bfa03b6295a0616a897441acec), labeled as Binance 8. The BNB ETHER reserves were comingled with non-BNB reserve ether, meaning you can't verify how much the BNB Ether is backed verse regular user funds. - **0% verifiably backed**
      * (very concerning and easier to understand) The [XRP](https://xrpscan.com/account/rJpj1Mv21gJzsbsVnkp1U4nqchZbmZ9pM5) proof of reserves wallet for the BNB Chain is just as bad as the ETHER but since it doesn't show any tokens **it's easier to see how bad it is**. It holds a total of 10 XRP. The rest was transferred to [this wallet](https://xrpscan.com/account/rs8ZPbYqgecRcDzQpJYAMhSxSi5htsjnza) \- a general Binance wallet for XRP, which interacts with [this wallet](https://xrpscan.com/account/rDAE53VfMvftPB4ogpWGWvzkQxfht6JPxr) \- the withdrawal address for users of XRP. Again all XRP in the BNB reserves have been comingled with regular user funds not in BNB. with no way to verify they hold sufficient XRP in the BNB chain. - **0% verifiably backed**

\-----------------------------------------------------

Binance lists 35 different crypto assets in their [Proof of Assets Page](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof), however in the top 200 cryptos by market cap, over 80 of them can be withdrawn as BEP2/20 tokens. Meaning there are at least 45 cryptos assets that do not have any sort of ""proof of asset"" listed. The total number of unbacked assets is even higher, as there are assets above 200+ by marketcap that can be withdrawn into the Binance ecosystem.

Even for assets that have a proof of reserve listed that doesn't mean it is adequately backed or backed at all. For example; ETH ERC2/20 tokens have no verifiable backing, XRP ERC2/20 tokens have no verifiable backing, ADA ERC2/20 tokens are 29.7% backed. LTC ERC2/20 tokens are 86.9% backed and those are just a few of the listed assets that I checked.

\----------------------------

**Complications**: This problem has been unchecked and inflated since, I posted about this issue [6 months ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uz09wu/binance_is_encouraging_withdrawingminting_your/). Since then XRP and ETHER have lost all verifiable backing and ADA backing dropped from 71% to \~30%.

It continues to be compounded by the fact that Binance encourages users to send their crypto into BEP 2/20 tokens by making it more expensive to send the asset into the native chain. As an example Dogecoin costs 1.94 Doge to withdraw as a BEP 2/20 token and 5 Doge to withdraw into the native Dogecoin network. This is standard practice for [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee)/[BinanceUS](https://www.binance.us/en/fee/schedule) for nearly all assets available to withdrawal into the Binance ecosystem, and the unbacked assets will likely continue to grow if left unchecked.

If the last few weeks haven't made it clear yet, the last people left holding unbacked assets end up with nothing.

# Edit:

As pointed out by [another user](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yxxugl/comment/iwrfyhd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Binance also no longer has proof of reserves of the **PAXD or the USDC stablecoin** both of which are still circulating in the BNB ecosystem. Both appear to have been comingled with regular user funds in the Binance 8 wallet (link below).

PAXD [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8e870d67f660d95d5be530380d0ec0bd388289e1?a=0x47ac0Fb4F2D84898e4D9E7b4DaB3C24507a6D503)

 bnb beacon chain bep tokens and bnb smart chain bep tokens are two native chains of the binance ecosystem binance allows users to withdraw lots of different crypto as tokens into their native chains which then allows users the ability to use those assets in the binance ecosystem
 as you can imagine this could create a few concerns the largest being binance could sellsend the underlying asset of the bep tokens as the user no longer holds the true crypto but a token on the binance ecosystem essentially allowing them to manipulate the total supply of those cryptos by creating fake bnb tokens with no actual backing on the native chain
 to ease concerns about artificial manipulation binance began providing proof of asset wallets where for crosschain assets ether xrp ada doge etc they should theoretically hold an underlying asset equal to the amount of the asset that is in the bep ecosystem this is supposed to ensure the binance asset you are holding is backed by an equal amount on its native chain and the supply is not being artificially manipulated
    the problem however is they do not provide a proof of asset list for most of their assets in the binance ecosystem additionally of those that have a proof of asset wallet most are not fully backed or actually list no real backing at all
       the ltc proof of reserve address holds k ltc however there are k ltc in the bnb ecosystem  k in the bep addresses and k in the bep addresses    backed
       the ada proof of reserve address holds m ada however there are m ada in the bnb ecosystem  m circulating in bep addresses and m circulating in bep addresses   backed
       very concerning the following is the listed proof of asset address for ether its supposed to hold all of the ether on the bnb ecosystem but it currently sits at  eth and the ether was moved to this address labeled as binance  the bnb ether reserves were comingled with nonbnb reserve ether meaning you cant verify how much the bnb ether is backed verse regular user funds   verifiably backed
       very concerning and easier to understand the xrp proof of reserves wallet for the bnb chain is just as bad as the ether but since it doesnt show any tokens its easier to see how bad it is it holds a total of  xrp the rest was transferred to this wallet  a general binance wallet for xrp which interacts with this wallet  the withdrawal address for users of xrp again all xrp in the bnb reserves have been comingled with regular user funds not in bnb with no way to verify they hold sufficient xrp in the bnb chain   verifiably backed



binance lists  different crypto assets in their proof of assets page however in the top  cryptos by market cap over  of them can be withdrawn as bep tokens meaning there are at least  cryptos assets that do not have any sort of proof of asset listed the total number of unbacked assets is even higher as there are assets above  by marketcap that can be withdrawn into the binance ecosystem

even for assets that have a proof of reserve listed that doesnt mean it is adequately backed or backed at all for example eth erc tokens have no verifiable backing xrp erc tokens have no verifiable backing ada erc tokens are  backed ltc erc tokens are  backed and those are just a few of the listed assets that i checked



complications this problem has been unchecked and inflated since i posted about this issue  months ago since then xrp and ether have lost all verifiable backing and ada backing dropped from  to 

it continues to be compounded by the fact that binance encourages users to send their crypto into bep  tokens by making it more expensive to send the asset into the native chain as an example dogecoin costs  doge to withdraw as a bep  token and  doge to withdraw into the native dogecoin network this is standard practice for binance for nearly all assets available to withdrawal into the binance ecosystem and the unbacked assets will likely continue to grow if left unchecked

if the last few weeks havent made it clear yet the last people left holding unbacked assets end up with nothing

 edit

as pointed out by another user binance also no longer has proof of reserves of the paxd or the usdc stablecoin both of which are still circulating in the bnb ecosystem both appear to have been comingled with regular user funds in the binance  wallet link below

533,1690892005.0,2023-08-01,"XRP got much more love than they deserve - Ripple is heavily centralized and fights real decentralization in the crypto space During the SEC lawsuit, I have noticed XRP getting a lot of love from the crypto community, and I can understand this. The SEC was never only going against Ripple as we have seen this year, so this entire lawsuit was somehow representative for all of crypto.

However now that things are somehow settled, we should face reality: XRP is just another heavily centralized project, no matter if it's a security or not. The consensus mechanism is literally proof of trust - The network runs on a bunch of bank owned servers, relying on all participants being doxxed. This is not innovative blockchain tech, this is the same old banking system using ""blockchain"" as a marketing term.

I could live with that alone or ignore it at least - XRP it's by far not the only centralized cryptocurrency. However Ripple has also done their best in the past to fight real decentralized cryptos like BTC and ETH:

They often attack BTC, for example Ripple CFO claimed BTC is controlled by China in 2020 ([source](https://gizmodo.com/ripple-claims-bitcoin-is-chinese-controlled-while-annou-1845932148)). The same claims were made against Ethereum according to Vitalik Buterin ([source](https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-faults-ripples-decentralization-claim-says-the-platform-is-completely-centralized/)), for which they never apologized.

Also most of you probably remember they funded a FUD energy campaign that tried to push Bitcoin towards PoS ([source](https://decrypt.co/96298/ripple-co-founder-backs-controversial-campaign-change-bitcoin-code)).

At this point people should really think twice if that's a project they want to support just because there is some bullish outlook after they won the case. Ripple is not using, but abusing ""blockchain"" - and they are certainly not your friends.","xrp got much more love than they deserve  ripple is heavily centralized and fights real decentralization in the crypto space during the sec lawsuit i have noticed xrp getting a lot of love from the crypto community and i can understand this the sec was never only going against ripple as we have seen this year so this entire lawsuit was somehow representative for all of crypto

however now that things are somehow settled we should face reality xrp is just another heavily centralized project no matter if its a security or not the consensus mechanism is literally proof of trust  the network runs on a bunch of bank owned servers relying on all participants being doxxed this is not innovative blockchain tech this is the same old banking system using blockchain as a marketing term

i could live with that alone or ignore it at least  xrp its by far not the only centralized cryptocurrency however ripple has also done their best in the past to fight real decentralized cryptos like btc and eth

they often attack btc for example ripple cfo claimed btc is controlled by china in  source the same claims were made against ethereum according to vitalik buterin source for which they never apologized

also most of you probably remember they funded a fud energy campaign that tried to push bitcoin towards pos source

Money\_talk\_tok announced on 24 February 2022 that he bet his house on XRP when XRP was around $0.69 (nice). The amount was $500K. He did that ""because there is so much fear in the market. Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy"". Yes this is a literal quote from the video.

His rationale for buying was based on the Fear & Greed Index because the market was at complete fear. Even though back then the Fear & Greed index was ""only"" at 23.

His ""investment"" went up initially, but then dropped 59% from the point of buying XRP, meaning that his $500K through mortaging his house was worth $205K 114 days later.

Right now, he is still down about 33% from his initial investment, even if XRP saw a 103% pump off the lows, which now retraced some again. Through in his words ""have I lost money? No I havent, because I havent sold"". 1 XRP = 1 XRP in his mind.

Why on earth would someone do this!?

That does not make the SEC look good at all. The emails are showing how much of a improper behavior they had towards certain Cryptos and advantages for other Crypto, namely Ethereum.

William Hinman a former SEC official met several Law firms in NYC and ETH Co-founders. That comes before he in 2018 announced that ETH is not a security, but Ripple is.

Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to list the Coinshares XRP ETF, arguing that XRP’s decentralized structure and deep liquidity make it difficult to manipulate. The ETF will function as a Delaware Statutory Trust, holding only XRP and cash, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP without direct ownership.

Key points from the filing:

•	⁠The ETF’s value will track the Compass Crypto Reference Index XRP (4 PM NY time).
•	⁠XRP will be securely stored by a third-party custodian to ensure safety.
•	⁠Nasdaq argues that XRP is less prone to manipulation than other digital assets previously approved for ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
•	⁠The SEC is now reviewing the proposal and seeking public comments before making a decision.

This move could significantly impact XRP’s market adoption, providing regulated institutional access to the asset and potentially increasing trading volumes. If approved, this ETF could mark a major milestone in XRP’s journey toward mainstream financial integration.

The reason for this post is because most people on this sub dislike XRP due to its centralised nature. However, the following reason - in my opinion - is why everyone should be cheering for Ripple in the ongoing lawsuit, no matter your opinion on XRP.

Let’s face it, XRP holders have had a rough few years after the lawsuit was announced in December 2020. However, as the years have gone on, we have seen countless amazing projects enter and drop out of the top 10 - Chainlink, Monero, Tezos - to name a few. Guess which coin has amazingly retained its top 10 spot, despite having the SEC on its back? You guessed it: XRP.

Regardless of whether you hold, love or hate XRP, Ripple are doing what pretty much all of us would love to do, and that’s give a huge middle finger to the SEC. One must realise that an SEC victory will put so many other projects under scrutiny, and this will not favour crypto well as a whole. We will witness many of our favourite projects being placed under the microscope of the regulators. However, if the lawsuit ends with a Ripple victory, it may potentially set up crypto for a (mini) bull run, as regulators are forced to lay off as we see some sort of regulatory clarity in our beloved industry. The crypto industry as a whole is likely to piggy-back off the success of the lawsuit, should we see a favourable victory. No one wants to be in Ripple’s position, but I’m sure we can all appreciate that Ripple has taken one for the team and is fighting one of the most important battles - not just for themselves, but for the entire crypto industry.

Whew! My goodness friends, what a week for Ripple. XRP holders, catalysts abound yet we remain stuck in by the bears. Let's do a quick recap anyway, and hope that the market begins to reflect the bullish news:

Michael Barr Confirmed: Michael Barr, a former Ripple adviser, is set to assume one of the most important U.S. regulatory roles after winning Senate confirmation to be vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve. Barr is considered an ally to crypto, but has tempered his sentiments with expectations that the market be regulated robustly. This appointment is widely considered good for crypto, and considering it's issues with the SEC - good for Ripple.

Netburn says 'the Hinman emails must be produced': The long awaited ruling has finally come down from Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn regarding the attorney-client privilege of conversations had with SEC lawyers by William Hinman. Judge Netburn unequivocally ruled in favor of Ripple, even slamming the 'hypocrisy' of the SEC in its attempted defense - asserting that the SEC isn't even attempting to follow the law in good faith. In his now infamous speech Hinman said that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not to be considered securities, despite ETH having conducted the same kind of unregistered token offerings as Ripple. The preperatory emails Hinman exchanged with SEC lawyers have been desperately guarded to this point, and it remains to be seen what the SEC will do. It seems likely that there will be a series of appeals to Judge Analise Torres, who is responsible for ruling on any appeals to Judge Netburn's decisions.

Jed's dead baby: Former Ripple CTO Jed McCaleb is almost done selling his 9 billion XRP after nearly 8 years. Jed left Ripple after having differences with the leadership team on the direction of the project there. Jed has since worked to bring Stellar (XLM) into the crypto space as a competitor to Ripple within the global payment settlement industry. It is believed that Jed has nearly completed selling his stack of XRP, (he holds approximately 10 million in his TacoStand account) which is estimated to be gone by weeks end. XRP fans are ecstatic about this, as the downward selling pressure has been significant from McCaleb for nearly a decade.

Other notes: Did you know that Ripple only controls about 5% of nodes on the XRPL? XRP is more decentralized than many crypto projects. The community drives most innovations on chain as well, and will soon deliver Smart Contracts to XRPL in a 100% community driven effort, minus any Ripple devs. Congrats!

Much to be excited for if you hold a bag of XRP.

Hi guys,

after yesterday’s news XRP has gotten up 12% and I was wondering whether (in case it gets finally approved) XRP could do a 10x/100x or just do an Ethereum.

I’m kinda new to altcoins (previously lost 85% on memecoins) and was wondering whether the reports were true or just XRP holders looking into getting exit liquidity.

I, a few months back, saw something similar for SOL after the mini crash/market correction and it went up 40%. 

I do obviously understand that there is some exaggeration by the XRP holders. But just to know whether it’s a meme-intended exaggeration or a realistic/ possible outcome.

Thanks to anyone who answers!v

And while it is true that all XRP might be pre-mined and capped at 100 billion, we have definitely seen plenty of inflation, meaning that there is quite a lot of inflation in the supply:

* Supply 25 June 2017: 38,291,387,790

* Supply 25 June 2023: 52,254,289,650

**That is a 33.85% increase in 6 years!**

But let's face it. That's like USD having 50% of its supply hidden that gets slowly released (inflating the supply of USD) and then claiming its not inflation because that 50% hidden supply was already ""pre-mined"". Thats not how it works.

Fact is, XRP's circulating supply increases over time. Not as much as other tokens like Immutable, Gala, Sand, and Mana. But plenty to make a difference. And Ripple dumps that XRP on users.

The image is the Bitcoin price chart during the last cycle. We see Bitcoin crash to 3k in 2018, followed by a retrace to the 0.618 retracement to 14k in 2019, then re-accumulation back down to the lows in early 2020 followed by price expansion, almost reaching a full 4.236 extension in 2021.

This image is the XRP price chart. XRP is showing a similar structure to Bitcoin's previous cycle but just behaving much more slowly which is why most people think the project is dead, retail investors don't have much patience. We observe that XRP crashed to $0.11 in 2020, then retraced to around the 0.618 at $2 in 2021, followed by re-accumulation in 2022-23 and now I believe we are about to enter the price expansion phase. If XRP was achieve a full 4.236 extension like bitcoin, then the target would be above $10.

Both the structure of bitcoin and XRP show: crash, retrace, re-accumulation and now price expansion.

However, I would like to offer some balance as well and want to re-iterate that XRP must break the 2021 high of $2 to show confirmation of an uptrend. Otherwise, it may make another lower high and that would cause XRP to deviate away from what BTC did last cycle. This bullish thesis hinges on XRP being able to break that 2021 high, so pay close attention to that.

I also believe that 2024 will be make or break for XRP. As I expect the inevitable hard landing of the US economy in the second half of this year. It's pretty much now or never for coins like XRP. If it is unable to do anything meaningful this year, I will have to conclude the project is dead because once the macro conditions turns ugly, there is no chance for any crypto to do well in that environment. The stock market is the force that drives crypto bull runs. However, I remain hopeful that we get our XRP bull run this year.

Most people on this subreddit hate XRP which is again another reason to be bullish. The herd of retail investors is generally wrong. They all expected 100k in 2021, they all thought crypto died in 2022, they all expected 12k in 2023, they hated Solana at the lows...the list is endless. When has the herd of retail investors ever been right about anything? Now they all expect the bull run to last until late 2025 lmao.

I am a firm believer of ""show me the chart and I will tell you the news"", so I am expecting some bullish narrative to emerge for XRP, who knows. Regardless, I think we can all agree that 2024 will be pivotal for coins like XRP. Look forward to hearing your thoughts!

It's just how the universe works.","why ripples xrp is poised for  i will present the case why xrp will reenter price discovery this year due to the very bullish chart structure i believe that xrp is imitating bitcoins previous cycle from  of course this is not financial advice you must proceed at your own caution and exercise appropriate risk management but i wanted to share my thoughts

i am a firm believer of show me the chart and i will tell you the news so i am expecting some bullish narrative to emerge for xrp who knows regardless i think we can all agree that  will be pivotal for coins like xrp look forward to hearing your thoughts

Also, what’s the sentiment of the sub on XRP nowadays? I recall from few years ago that was not under a good light.

10741,1637164811.0,2021-11-17,"ETH is bad, and I am tired of pretending it's not. I am going to open up by saying that some of the following is going to be FACT and some of it will be OPINION. However, the opinion will never prevail over the facts. Also, depending on traction I may do a second post with some more up to debate things.  
I also know that the title alone will lead to downvotes, some of you won’t even read it before downvoting. It is a shame that people forgot downvotes are supposed to be used to penalize off-topic and not to punish unpopular opinions, not to create echo chambers.    
So let’s get to it shall we?   

**ETH is shady:**  
Not only is ETH a security, it has always been manipulated by well connected and powerful people behind the scenes. The connections between the ETH Foundation, ConsenSys, and the SEC are totally public knowledge. 
Jay Clayton, the former SEC chairman, was a partner at Sullivan and Cromwell.    
Joe Lubin, co-founder of ETH, also founded ConsenSys. He also bought 9.5% of ETH supply.   
ConsenSys is a client of Sullivan and Cromwell.  
That was the back door ETH used to get the free pass on regulations.  
There are court papers about the meetings between ConsenSys and the SEC.  
At the same time, the SEC was prosecuting DOZENS of ICOs that were using the exact same approach ETH was.  
Hinman’s, Clayton’s Director of Corporate Finance, speech where he says ETH is not a security was partly WRITTEN by some of ETH top investors.  
The plan by ConsenSys with the help of the SEC was clearly to make ETH the only crossborders payment platform by giving it a free pass, while at the same time preventing any incursion into that space with SEC lawsuits.   
At the same time this was happening, Gary Gensler told an MIT audience that “XRP deserved regulatory clarity”.  (I won’t go in depth with the Ripple lawsuit here).  
Not only is Chairman Gensler trying to pretend he never said that, and the entire SEC trying to hide the fact they gave ETH a free pass, to date ETH is the only altcoin to have had the privilege of being formally consider a commodity/currency and not a security.   
Other funny “coincidences” include: Claydon being hired by a crypto hedge fund 100% invested in BTC and ETH. SEC Enforcement Director Marc Berger being hired by Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett, part of the ETH Alliance and Hinman’s prior employer, less than a month after the Ripple lawsuit was filled. Hinman receiving $15 Million, during his service on the SEC, from  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett. AND after leaving the SEC, Hinman returned to  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett as a senior crypto adviser.  

**ETH is centralized:**  
Users and nodes have no real power to shape the protocol. This is virtually true of all protocols with a Foundation at it’s head, but we can’t forget ETH falls under this group.  
The first piece of evidence here is the ETC hard fork. This fork happened because the wrong people lost money. The changed the code and the protocol for the first time to suit the wealthy whales and not the users or miners. They changed the rules to fit their goals.    
The second piece comes in the form of changes to mining rewards. This was a blatant attempt to decrease supply by not paying the miners. More important than the way it impacts the economics of ETH, it points towards a centralisation of power. Rules can be changed on the fly with no consideration from the community but based on profits alone for the higher ups.  
This leads us to the PoS change. This has nothing to do with energy concerns or with price of fees. This is meant to skip all the intermediate problems by getting rid of miners and let the token holders leverage their will directly. Don’t forget the LUDICROUS amount of ETH that was pre-mined.  
Every hard fork the Ethereum blockchain has enacted has always been for the benefit of the few, never for the benefits of the community. You know what that looks like? Our current banking system. Where the citizens and the working class pay the price for mistakes and reap none of the rewards for profit.  
People in this sub hate central bank digital currencies, failing to see that every abuse these could enact on the public, so can Ethereum upon it’s users.    
To quote one of my sources “Etherium is not a decentralized peer-to-peer system. It is a system with an unaccountable ruling class exploiting the working class, making promises they can’t keep, while spinning a wonderful narrative.”  
  
**ETH recent and future design is bad:**  
Everyone was fooled into thinking EIP 1559 was going to be a good thing. How the Foundation pulled that off is honestly mind boggling.  
This change made it so fees were more uniform. Uniformly high. And making sure that miners saw none of that profit by burning it.   
Burning the fees essentially made sure that the biggest holders get they profits increased because every ETH is worth more, while miners that actually keep the network safe get a pay cut because there are less fees per block for them.  
But the biggest problem is that you are getting a landlorded network to users. If you want ETH to be useful, you need to, well, use it. But this model makes it so the interests of holders are opposite to the interests of users. Users want lower fees so they can use the network to transact, but holders want higher fees, for more burn and more profit.  
Taking money out of the pockets of miners decreases security. If you are paid less you have a higher incentive to get your money some other ways.   
And since users and holders have different agendas, future goals benefit different people. An interesting question would be for instance what happens in the case of a block size adjustment? Bigger or smaller block sized benefit users and holders differently.
Well, given ETH’s history, you know how those chips would fall. Even this decision was reached by a small amount of key players.  
And PoS will only make this whole process more straight forward. The fact that the token holding are already so centralized will make changes easier for the ruling class and be baked into the system.    

**In conclusion:**    
ETH’s had a shady start, has been controlled by a group of shadow players on the background, is becoming less and less secure and has no intention of not being.    
At any point, any decision can be hard forked in. The miners don’t matter. Your nodes don’t matter.  
ETH is INTENDED to shackle you the exact same way the current banking system does.    
Don’t be fooled.

1176,1732914715.0,2024-11-29,"I hope people can see whats happening with US based cryptos and Bitcoin Crypto investor since 2017, made good money, enough to quit my job in my mid 30s and travel and start a business and do other things I want with my life. Doesnt mean I know anything.

It is my belief that at some point, just like every other market, there will be a bust/selection period where 99% of projects become worthless. Of the remaining survivors, maybe 5-6 take up 80-85% of the market share, 5-6 take up 5-10% and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 5-10%

Example: Theres Verizon, Att, T mobile at the top, then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile, then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about. There are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries. Tons of tv companies, 5-6 that people know, dozens that we dont, 100s of other ones, and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place.

This is what will happen IMO because it always does, since forever.

And while I dont really care if youre a fan of the US or not, the US is the strongest economy in the world, and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the US and global narrative. Im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world, but I think it's ignorant to outright say it wont matter.

With the US and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve, its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future.

I believe this is also why we have the Dino/US coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like Hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators, meeting with senators, getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us. Founders have all recently met, are all ISO 20022 compliant, and are all going nuts. I think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and I just want people to be aware of it. These projects **XLM XRP ADA HBAR ALGO** are outperforming a lot of other coins and I believe this is why, despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened.

I am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if I had just kept my money where I had it 7 years ago in these Dino coins (in XRP and ADA anyways), id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects. Look at the narrative, research it, and make an educated guess. Do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out, because it will at some point in the not so distant future.","i hope people can see whats happening with us based cryptos and bitcoin crypto investor since  made good money enough to quit my job in my mid s and travel and start a business and do other things i want with my life doesnt mean i know anything

it is my belief that at some point just like every other market there will be a bustselection period where  of projects become worthless of the remaining survivors maybe  take up  of the market share  take up  and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 

example theres verizon att t mobile at the top then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile then theres  that nobody knows anything about there are s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries tons of tv companies  that people know dozens that we dont s of other ones and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place

this is what will happen imo because it always does since forever

and while i dont really care if youre a fan of the us or not the us is the strongest economy in the world and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the us and global narrative im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world but i think its ignorant to outright say it wont matter

with the us and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future

i believe this is also why we have the dinous coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators meeting with senators getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us founders have all recently met are all iso  compliant and are all going nuts i think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and i just want people to be aware of it these projects xlm xrp ada hbar algo are outperforming a lot of other coins and i believe this is why despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened

i am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if i had just kept my money where i had it  years ago in these dino coins in xrp and ada anyways id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects look at the narrative research it and make an educated guess do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out because it will at some point in the not so distant future",hope people see whats happening u based cryptos bitcoin crypto investor since made good money enough quit job mid travel start business thing want life doesnt mean know anything belief point like every market bustselection period project become worthless remaining survivor maybe take market share take remaining hundred thousand coin make last example there verizon att mobile top there tracfone boost mint mobile there nobody know anything brand battery company actually make battery ton tv company people know dozen dont one handful huge manufacturer make everyones tv place happen imo always since forever dont really care youre fan u u strongest economy world best position harness benefit control direction space u global narrative im saying best crypto world think ignorant outright say wont matter u country getting board strategic reserve clear bitcoin continue winner foreseeable future believe also dinous coin pumping leader recently meeting together like hoskinson even getting involved directly legislator meeting senator getting front congress talking best u founder recently met iso compliant going nut think winning recipe cycle future want people aware project xlm xrp ada hbar algo outperforming lot coin believe despite people starting call irrelevant happened saying third cycle space wasted time money looking pumpy coin kept money year ago dino coin xrp ada anyways id proven right early conviction project look narrative research make educated guess ignore trend ok take risk meme coin little bit portfolio make sure right side history shake point distant future

First, XRP won its lawsuit against the SEC, and now Grayscale won a court ruling to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

A three-judge appeals panel vacated a decision by the SEC that blocked the ETF, ruling that the SEC had failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two BTC futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed BTC ETP.

Exact words:

>The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale’s proposed bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale’s petition for review and vacate the Commission’s order.

And the victories of XRP and Grayscale are a major setback for the SEC, which has been criticized for its slow and cautious approach to cryptocurrency regulation. The SEC has been hesitant to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, arguing that they could be susceptible to fraud and manipulation. However, the appeals panel found that the SEC had not provided any evidence to support this claim.

Grayscale has said that it is actively reviewing the details outlined in the Court's opinion and will be pursuing next steps with the SEC as the SEC has not yet replied on the decision. It remains to be seen whether the SEC will approve Grayscale's Bitcoin ETP or be a crybaby again and appeal the ruling.

This is really big, and it could lead to more investment in the market by large entities. The ruling could also prompt other regulators to take a closer look at the cryptocurrency market, and soon we might have proper rules and regulations. It's a major win for Grayscale and for the industry as a whole and could pave the way for spot bitcoin ETFs to be approved by the SEC.

Now, after XRP and Grayscale won their respective cases against the SEC, it's now Coinbase's turn to show the SEC's bias against cryptocurrency. Sooner or later, Gary is going to get sacked, it's personal now.

191,1638367333.0,2021-12-01,"I hold XRP out of respect because they're taking it for the team... XRP Ripple is slugging it out in court, they could have settled to the EVIL EMPIRE (THE USA) but they didn't. They held their ground because the FEDs were being bullies and really haven't established a firm definition on crypto and seemed to use definitions on a whim. 

Ripple is a real-time macro settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network created by Ripple Labs Inc., a US-based technology company. Released in 2012, Ripple is built upon a distributed open source protocol, and supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities, or other units of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes. Ripple purports to enable ""secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks."" The ledger employs the native cryptocurrency known as XRP.

In December 2020, Ripple Labs and two of its executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for selling XRP tokens, which the SEC classified as unregistered securities.

However, it was evident in the trial that XRP told Ripple earlier (court document revealed) that they weren't a security.

I am baffled why the judge has not thrown out this case. However, there are rumours that XRP might settle.

The devil is in the details. XRP Ripple has signaled that they wil be hiring several hundreds of people. A JP Morgan report sent to investors earlier this month put XRP and the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit under the spotlight and concluded that a win would put the crypto asset on the road to mainstream adoption. More on that, here.

Coinbase, which was mentioned as a key player for XRP adoption, announced it will participate in the forum and will be represented by CEO Brian Armstrong and Lead Independent Director Fred Wilson. 

Ripple has successfully accelerated its global expansion this year despite fears that the lawsuit could cause hesitancy among institutional partners. Now it seems that the blockchain firm will be hiring a few hundreds in 2022 as they prepare the launch of the upcoming Liquidity Hub.

On top of that, the XRP Ledger has just had a “game-changer” upgrade that took a year to come into effect and it’s likely to strengthen its appeal. Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz said it was “awesome news”.

So, in conclusion, where RIPPLE goes so goes the industry as they say.","i hold xrp out of respect because theyre taking it for the team xrp ripple is slugging it out in court they could have settled to the evil empire the usa but they didnt they held their ground because the feds were being bullies and really havent established a firm definition on crypto and seemed to use definitions on a whim

0,1741826134.0,2025-03-13,"Buzz around that the U.S. government could theoretically benefit from buying XRP at $10,000/coin. Can it happen? 
Lately all over social media, Again the buzz has been going around as follows: 

The U.S. government could theoretically benefit from buying XRP at $10,000 per token for several reasons, as outlined in speculative theories. 

Global Financial Dominance: By acquiring XRP and pegging its price at $10,000, the U.S. could establish XRP as a global reserve asset. This would allow the U.S. to maintain influence over international financial systems even in a post-dollar era.

Market Stability and Manipulation Prevention: A fixed price for XRP would reduce the risk of market manipulation by foreign powers like China. Even large-scale dumps of XRP would not affect its value below the benchmark price, safeguarding the financial system from potential economic warfare.

Blockchain Driven Economy: XRP’s use in instant settlements and tokenized assets could support a blockchain-based financial ecosystem. This would modernize the economy and facilitate transactions at a massive scale.

Leverage Through Treasury Bills (T-Bills): Instead of paying cash, the government could use T-Bills for the purchase, which Ripple could hold as reserves, collateral, or sell for liquidity. This approach strengthens the U.S. dollar’s relevance while transitioning to a blockchain-based economy.

Setting a Global Standard: A fixed XRP price endorsed by institutions like the IMF or Federal Reserve could force other nations to adopt this valuation or risk being excluded from global financial markets.

Arguments of XRP reaching astronomical amounts been buzzing around again and now over speculations of the Gov. swapping Tbills for Ripple's escrow triggering astronomical price growth...

So Why again does this happen time and again? Speculation (and also white paper research) done on XRP reaching into the thousands???

46,1732016082.0,2024-11-19,"Possible Collaboration of XRP & ADA? This is all just my speculation, here are some events which happened recently for ADA and XRP:

\-Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson announced plans to work with the incoming Trump administration to develop clear crypto regulations. 

\-Charles Hoskinson talked to the CEO of Ripple (Brad Garlinghouse), and it seems like they buried their beef. Also Charles was saying the CEO was ""extremly collaborative"" 

\-Now he had a talk with the Chief of Technology (CTO) of Ripple. Maybe they plan to collaborate and that's why he talked with the CTO of Ripple afterwards? 

\-Trump plans to remove capital gains tax from US cryptocurrencies (this would include XRP and ADA)

\- There is a rumor Brad Garlinghouse met with Trump 

There are many common grounds and goals and a very promising environment. The market is reacting and the price of those coins are moving despite there is not an official partnership announcement.

81,1686858122.0,2023-06-15,"ADA, Matic, Atom, Sol, Algo and others were deemed a security a week ago. When this happened to XRP, XRP also dropped hard for a week straight. After that week, XRP did a 11x in 15 weeks. Almost 7 days ago, the SEC called many popular tokens a security, such as Cardano, Matic, Solana, Atom, Algorand, Near, and others. They have all seen major losses over the past week. In 7 days, they dropped:

* ADA: -19%
* Solana: -22%
* Matic: -24%
* Atom: -9%
* Near: -14%
* Algo: -10%

Fear is high, and many people have sold or are considering selling. Is it over for these cryptocurrencies? Perhaps not!

&#x200B;

A similar thing happened to XRP, when Ripple was sued by the SEC on December 22, 2020, because XRP was alleged to be a security. XRP instantly started crashing and went down 67% in a week! A much more severe reaction. Everyone panicked and thought it was over. Many people capitulated.

[XRP capitulation: -67&#37; in 7 days.](https://preview.redd.it/orsw1v4ee86b1.png?width=1877&format=png&auto=webp&s=877b3a04fafa9dd6c10500fa93bd0c28534250d7)

.. but it was not the end. A week after the lawsuit started, XRP hit the price of $0.17. That was the ultimate buying moment. From that point, XRP did about a 11x to $1.96 in 15 weeks! Also, the $0.17 price was not seen again.

[Orange line: $0.17 bottom \(7 days after lawsuit\); purple line: price the moment Ripple got sued](https://preview.redd.it/gadu1apjf86b1.png?width=1881&format=png&auto=webp&s=e70cb0e9d447c309fb14f85e198f90bc2ad50249)

If you bought the blood, you would still be up more than a 2x now. That said, even now, XRP is below the price of $0.52 - the price it had when Ripple was sued by the SEC.

Im not saying that the same thing must happen to the alts called a security now. But it might be good to know that buying the blood with XRP paid off. It was the final shakeout (""spring"") before liftoff.","ada matic atom sol algo and others were deemed a security a week ago when this happened to xrp xrp also dropped hard for a week straight after that week xrp did a x in  weeks almost  days ago the sec called many popular tokens a security such as cardano matic solana atom algorand near and others they have all seen major losses over the past week in  days they dropped

14820,1612872205.0,2021-02-09,"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence. I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.

43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.

50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.","for the newcomers the top  cryptocurrencies each explained with one sentence i tried summing up the top  coins in  or  sentences it is not perfect and you obviously shouldnt make any decision based on this list but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects theyre interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology

Ripple, the company responsible for the XRP cryptocurrency, unlocked one billion units in July and, of that total, kept 200 million for itself. The amount can be put into circulation at any time and this inflationary process is repeated every month, which may impact the price and investments in the asset.

These XRPs held by Ripple in July amounts to around $94 million, at the time of writing, and the company has absolute freedom to use (or sell) these crypto assets as it sees fit.

In the case of selling, the amount represents more than 10% of the average daily trading volume of XRP on the market, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/) — which could impact its price.

Analysing [Binance’s order book](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/XRP_USDT?theme=dark&type=spot), responsible for the highest liquidity of XRP in the market, 200 million would be enough to completely clear all buy orders on all available spot pairs this Sunday (9).

This event, which can create strong selling pressure, is repeated every month and will continue like this for at least the next four years.

I’ve delved into XRP’s supply inflation system to understand and explain how these monthly releases works.

## How XRP supply inflation works

When XRP was created in 2012, the currency's ledger programmed a maximum of 100 billion units. Of which 20 billion was initially distributed between its creators and the core team behind the project.

80 billion came under the control of Ripple's treasury, which promised not to use the entire available supply at once, but to spend these coins gradually. In 2017, the team decided to [implement](https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-escrows-55-billion-xrp-for-supply-predictability/) a new system, aiming to provide more predictability in increasing the circulating supply (which moves from the Treasury Accounts to the market).

The [escrow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrow.asp) system was implemented. It is a type of [smart contract](https://ripple.com/insights/explanation-ripples-xrp-escrow/) that locks XRPs, making their use impossible, to be unlocked under some previously programmed conditions.

Ripple’s condition was to unlock one billion XRP on the first day of each month of each subsequent month, for a total of 55 months — or 55 billion XRP that still remained to be put into circulation.

However, even with a monthly release of a billion, not all of it was spent or sold by the company. In this way, Ripple began to lock in the remaining amount monthly, in new escrow contracts for the future. Extending the 55-month deadline for all XRPs to be released.

According to Messari, the XRP circulating supply has already increased by 8% in the last 12 months. Resulting in an approximate annual inflation in this value. There are currently 52.25 billion XRP circulating in the market.

## Where are the 1 billion XRP unlocked in July?

Following the onchain trails of Ripple's latest escrow release, I’ve found that out of the total 1 billion XRP, 800 million were rescheduled to be unlocked within \~3,5 years.

100 million adds to the previous 900 million for release on December 1, 2026; while 700 million started a new escrow that will only be unlocked on the first day of 2027.

Still, Ripple kept 200 million liquid XRP for this month.

https://preview.redd.it/habpwgudqxab1.png?width=2008&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f794b5ce21eb214bdab0fbcc14f5180f09d7b9c

In the cash flow graph, one billion XRP were unlocked (by escrow) on July 1, 2023. Split into five transactions, destined for two wallet addresses controlled by Ripple: [Ripple (22)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rp6aTJmW3nq1aKt3Jmuz4DPRxksT5PBjpH) and [Ripple (23)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rsjFB8mPWqiZgPUaVh8XYqdfa59PE2d5LG).

Each address received 500 million XRP. The Ripple (23) address forwarded everything to another address controlled by the company, [Ripple (10)](https://xrpscan.com/account/r9UUEXn3cx2seufBkDa8F86usfjWM6HiYp), which total value was fully locked in the new escrow for January 1, 2027.

The 500 million XRP received by Ripple (22) were split into two new transactions:

* 200 million sent to [Ripple (1)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rBg2FuZT91C52Nny68houguJ4vt5x1o91m), which remain liquid and available for use by Ripple;
* 300 million sent to [Ripple (11)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rB3WNZc45gxzW31zxfXdkx8HusAhoqscPn), which was again split and locked into two different escrows. One expiring on December 1, 2026 (100 million XRP); and another on January 1, 2027 (200 million XRP).

***Find the full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the FOUR YEAR REPORT for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,** and **Stellar.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting every single month for four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the [2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/). ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.
* **December** **Highlights:** A bloody, all-red month
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** solidly in the lead, followed by **BTC** and **ADA.**  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, ***the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&P 500*** over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?
* A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (**fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).

***Some exciting new changes for*** [2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!***

1. I'll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)
2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. 
3. Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).
4. Giveaways: Who doesn’t love a good old fashioned giveaway? I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.
5. Friendly competition: I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP r/TotalCryptoMarketCap) to see which one outperforms.

And here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Four Year Report – UP 34%

https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=380248b14486edaa5749fba7a390198bf81260a0

Welcome to the four year report!

The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,** and **Stellar**.  

December highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **100% red month**. **IOTA** falls the least, only down -4% (on news that staking on the Firefly wallet will yield two cryptos, Assembly and Shimmer).
* **ETH** maintains a solid overall lead, **BTC** in second place, **ADA** in third.  Three coins in the green since January 2018.
* After four years, the 2018 Portfolio is +34%, behind the S&P 500’s ROI over the same time period.

## December Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2eadc9a98ec75b726cef37af7cb716fddf3126db

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** After four years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Tether**, **DOT, SOL**, **LUNA**, and **USDC.  NEM** looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.

## December Winners and Losers

***December Winners*** –  **IOTA** outperformed the pack, dropping only -4% this month. 100% of the cryptos in the red.

***December Losers*** –   Losing nearly a third of its value, **Litecoin** fell the most, down -30%. **NEM** followed **LTC**, dropping -27% in December.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After four years, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59

With 11, **Bitcoin** has two more monthly wins than second place **Cardano**.  **NEM** has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).

**Bitcoin** is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).

## Overall Update –  2021 ends with a whimper. After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in [October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.  After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: **BTC,** **ETH,** and **ADA.**

Overall, first place **ETH** (+413%) is well ahead of **BTC** (+257%) and third place **ADA** (+99%).

The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** four years ago?  It’s worth $515 today.

**DASH** and **NEM** are virtually tied at the bottom, both down over -86% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**  The initial $100 invested in each four ago is worth about $13 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=d82435bc0e39657707f2143fb5dd1951f6ddcfd1

End of December 2021 market cap: **$2,211,626,655,207**

The total crypto market dropped significantly in December.  Crypto as a sector is still up +285% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for **Ethereum)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=567958cf7214839fa7befa749d61125dade6a9a8

**BitDom** declined a bit in December, ending the month at 40.2%.  When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame, **BTC** dominance is near the low end.  For context:   

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25b3da0034194812e2b66f977450fff1555b48fb

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $325 in December.

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,341**, up 34% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.  Over the first four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.  And all ten of the green months have come in 2021. 

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:

https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6

The all time high for this portfolio is [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).   

Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the ***2019***, ***2020,*** and ***2021*** Top Ten Cryptos as well (***(and, just announced,*** [***again in 2022***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!)***.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48): up +34% (total value $1,341)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36) up +504% (total value $6,044)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24): up +795% (total value $8,951)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +292% (total value $3,921)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,257** ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).

**That’s up +406%** on the combined portfolios, **down from** [**last month’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47) for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2cd4923360a5492259faf606b3649c893fd4b16

***That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  

https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e68ae4c88a82ff35b70538ec11dd137e83447e2

After four years: the S&P 500 is up +78% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1,780 had it been redirected to the S&P.  That’s more than double the +34% return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio over the same period of time.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430** ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270)

That is up **+61%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+406%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

Here’s a fancy new chart showing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

## Conclusion:

Many thanks to the long-time Experiment followers, appreciate you taking the time to follow along over the years.  For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow give you a taste of what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and try to enjoy the ride! Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for monthly progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects where I repeat the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of [January 1st, 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36), [January 1st, 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24), [January 1st, 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12), and most recently, [January 1st, 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/).","i bought k of the top  cryptos on january st  four year report

welcome to your monthly noshill data dump heres the four year report for the  top ten experiment featuring btc xrp eth bch ada ltc nem dash iota and stellar

tldr

 whats this all about i purchased  of each of top  cryptos in jan  havent sold or traded reporting every single month for four years did the same in    and more recently the  top ten a few weeks ago learn more about the history and rules of the experiments here snapshots taken on the st of each month
 december highlights a bloody allred month
 overall since jan  eth solidly in the lead followed by btc and ada  after briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year the  top ten are now significantly underperforming the sp  over the same time period  q so big crypto fail right
 a only if i stopped after the first year  the  combined top ten portfolios are returning  much much better than traditional markets over the same time period fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post

some exciting new changes for 

 ill focus on  top ten portfolio reports  one other portfolio on a rotating basis down to two reports per month
 incorporated decentralized finance defi for the first time 
 factoring in stablecoin gains  in past years i have not included the roi that is possible with stables in the monthly reports  this year i will detail ways to build on the  of usdc in the  portfolio and gamify it a bit my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the  top ten portfolio as possible simple if it turns out to be a bear year a bit more challenging if the  market moons
 giveaways who doesnt love a good old fashioned giveaway ill be giving away crypto during the year either through twitter reddit or my email list im still figuring out the details but aim to give away around  a month in crypto
 friendly competition i will compare my homemade  top ten crypto index fund experiment to a total crypto market cap index token tcap rtotalcryptomarketcap to see which one outperforms

and here we go

 four year report  up 



welcome to the four year report

the  top ten crypto index fund portfolio is btc xrp eth bch ada ltc iota nem dash and stellar  

december highlights for the  top ten portfolio

  red month iota falls the least only down  on news that staking on the firefly wallet will yield two cryptos assembly and shimmer
 eth maintains a solid overall lead btc in second place ada in third  three coins in the green since january 
 after four years the  portfolio is  behind the sp s roi over the same time period

 december ranking and dropouts

heres a look at the movement in ranks since january 



top ten dropouts since january  after four years of the  top ten experiment only  of the cryptos that started in the top ten have remained  nem dash stellar bitcoin cash iota and litecoin have been replaced by binance coin tether dot sol luna and usdc  nem looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the top 

 december winners and losers

december winners   iota outperformed the pack dropping only  this month  of the cryptos in the red

december losers    losing nearly a third of its value litecoin fell the most down  nem followed ltc dropping  in december

 tally of monthly winners and losers

after four years heres a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the  top ten experiment 



with  bitcoin has two more monthly wins than second place cardano  nem has finished last place most often  months out of 

bitcoin is still the only cryptocurrency that hasnt yet lost a month since january  although it has come very close a couple of times

 overall update    ends with a whimper after four years eth in first place and dash and nem tied for worst overall performance

after reaching an all time high  in october the  top ten portfolio continued to lose value  after four years of holding these cryptos only  out of the  cryptos are in the green btc eth and ada

overall first place eth  is well ahead of btc  and third place ada 

the initial  invested in first place eth four years ago  its worth  today

dash and nem are virtually tied at the bottom both down over  since january   the initial  invested in each four ago is worth about  today  

 total market cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector



end of december  market cap 

the total crypto market dropped significantly in december  crypto as a sector is still up  since january   

there was no easy way to achieve this at the time but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since new years day  youd be doing much much better than the experiments top ten approach  the return of the sp  over the same period of time and nine of the individual cryptos within the  top ten except for ethereum

crypto market cap low point in the  top ten crypto index experiment b in january 

crypto market cap high point in the  top ten crypto index experiment t in october 

 bitcoin dominance



bitdom declined a bit in december ending the month at   when looking at the entire four year  experiment time frame btc dominance is near the low end  for context   

low point in the  top ten crypto index experiment  in january 

high point in the  top ten crypto index experiment  in august 

 overall return on  investment since january st  



the  top ten portfolio lost  in december

if i decided to cash out the  top ten experiment today the  initial investment would be worth  up  from january   

green is unfamiliar territory for the  top ten portfolio and a recent development  over the first four years of the  index fund experiment thirtyeight months have been in the red with only ten months of green  and all ten of the green months have come in  

heres a look at the roi over the life of the experiment month by month since the beginning of the  experiment four years ago



the all time high for this portfolio is october    the lowest point was in january  when the  top ten portfolio was down    

remember no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow let alone next month or next year  the  top ten crypto portfolio was down  after one year  after two years  after three years

 combining the    and  top ten crypto portfolios

alright thats that for the  top ten crypto index fund experiment recap

but i didnt stop the experiment in   i invested another  in the   and  top ten cryptos as well and just announced again in   how are the other crypto index fund experiments doing    

  top ten experiment up  total value 
  top ten experiment up  total value 
  top ten experiment up  total value 
  top ten experiment up  total value 

so overall taking the four portfolios together heres the bottom bottom bottom bottom line 

after a  investment in the    and  top ten cryptocurrencies the combined portfolios are worth        

thats up  on the combined portfolios down from last months all time high for the combined top ten index fund experiments  heres the combined monthly roi since i started tracking the metric in january 



thats a  gain by investing k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the top ten on january st including stablecoins for four years in a row

 comparison to sp 

im also tracking the sp  as part of the experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options  



after four years the sp  is up  since january  so the initial k investment into crypto on january st  would be worth  had it been redirected to the sp  thats more than double the  return of the  top ten crypto portfolio over the same period of time

taking the same investonjanuarystofeachyear approach with the sp  that ive been documenting through the top ten crypto experiments the yields are the following

  investment in sp  on january st    today
  investment in sp  on january st    today
  investment in sp  on january st    today
  investment in sp  on january st    today

taken together heres the bottom bottom bottom bottom line for a similar approach with the sp 

after four  investments into an sp  index fund in january    and  my portfolio would be worth        

that is up  since january  compared to a  gain of the combined top ten crypto experiment portfolios

heres a fancy new chart showing the four year roi comparison between a top ten crypto approach and the sp as per the rules of the top ten experiments 



 conclusion

When XRP dropped from $2.80 down below $2 I set an auto sell for $30k at $2.80 which it hit last week (yay for profit!). Now I’m in this weird position where I have $30k sitting in my account waiting to be used and freaking everything is at an extreme high. I don’t want to put it back in XRP and just accept losing the .35 in gains I missed, far too stubborn for that. I have a good amount of confidence things will continue to grow after tomorrow but you never know and I don’t want to be buying bitcoin at $105k just to watch it correct back down to $75k in a couple weeks. I’m kind of at a loss for what to do with it. I like coins that I understand and ideally have some utility or logic based reason they will go up over time (XRP utility, BTC strategic reserves etc). I don’t really touch meme coins at all. 

Any ideas on options that are not at an all time high or have some compelling reason to grow beyond where they’re at now? Anything you guys think is currently undervalued?

244,1618042225.0,2021-04-10,"Congrats to anyone who (like me) hodled XRP for the past 3-4 years! In early January 2018, I was persuaded to fomo into XRP, promised it'd make me one day rich...

Little did I know what I was about to get into, or that I was about to throw huge chunks of money too close to this shitcoin's ATH.

The following 3-4 years became all about hodling and pretty much accepting that my money was as good as lost, and that was fine, seeing as I knew the risks involved.

Today, for the first time since that trade first went into negative figures, I am seeing it turn green again, and I wanted to congratulate anyone else who like me has had the patience and endurance of hodling similar shitcoins for so long.

Never give up guys, and have a great day!

EDIT: I'm blown away by the amount of toxicity this post has received. Just to clarify a few things: I am NOT new to crypto and XRP was merely my first ever investment back in 2018, and now makes up a tiny percentage of my portfolio.

Regardless, some of the arrogance being displayed by some of these self-proclaimed ""experienced"" traders/investors towards anyone they deem to be new to crypto, is one of the main recurring issues I keep on coming across in this sub. Honestly, what is the point?

And, if you're new around here, don't let any of these kinds of comments disrupt your financial plans or your spirits towards the crypto community. Most people are actually very welcoming and helpful.","congrats to anyone who like me hodled xrp for the past  years in early january  i was persuaded to fomo into xrp promised itd make me one day rich

99% of coins shilled on this sub passes the Howy test as defined below:

1. An investment of money
2. In a common enterprise
3. With the expectation of profit
4. To be derived from the efforts of others

Certain cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) may be found to meet the definition of an ""investment contract"" under the test, especially ETH and XRP.

ETH ICO was conducted by a small group of centralised heads, VC investors, developers, as with any private company (therefore not decentralised) and carried out in Switzerland to circumvent SEC regulations. 

Now that ETH has gone PoS and has locked up billions of dollars worth of tokens for “staking”, we have a particularly odd situation where only a couple developers have the power to write the code to return the locked up funds back to retail investors. This is no different to an investment contract applied to any regulated publicly traded company.

BTC is the only cryptocurrency that is universally agreed upon (by regulators SEC and CFTC) to be a commodity. That is all.

Therefore everything else will eventually be scrutinised as a security thus the likes of Ripple, Cardano and ETH foundation will have to go public with *full* financial disclosures.

You can bet on all potential investors evaporating immediately once this happens and all the alts in the space will fall like dominoes.

The proposal aims to accelerate banking adoption by overriding resistance and allowing banks to use XRP immediately for Nostro account replacement. ￼ 2.

60,1680453921.0,2023-04-02,"Why are XRP and XLM on a tear lately? Maybe its due to the ""banking crisis"" or maybe its wishful thinking that the SEC will lose its case against Ripple. Maybe its both.

XRP is up 16% in the last 7 days and XLM is up 20%. What hype is driving this run in the midsts of the bear market? Let's learn a little about both projects first.

In the world of crypto currency that aims to improve if not replace banking transactions for the average human things like XRP and XLM provide improvements in remittance and asset tokenization. For example XRP's, five main applications of the XRP Ledger are payments, tokenization, DeFi, CBDCs and stablecoins.  What is important is this. They claim that using their ledger include its low-cost ($0.0002 to transact), speed (settling transactions in 3-5 seconds), scalability (1,500 transactions per second) and inherently green attributes (carbon-neutral and energy-efficient). XLM is very similar and rides on XRP's co tail so whatever happens to Ripple may bring success or failure to the Stellar Foundation. This is not changing anytime soon. XLM goes as XRP goes. 

Now that you know a little about XRP you also know about XLM but what about number going up?  Is it all mere speculation on the fact that Ripple will defeat the SEC in its lawsuit or is it because the banking crisis is providing a legitimate use case to both projects as it comes to remittances, payments and banking efficiency and transparency. I honestly do not have the answer so I came to this sub to find out some opinions and thoughts. 

What I do know is that if the SEC loses to Ripple then XRP might go parabolic as the entire US market will then have access to it. News flash. Coinbase has announced re listing XRP in the near future. This could be bullish AF for Ripple but its all TBD. Where do you think all this goes?

In 2021, they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in New York has increased by $6 per month because of mining. 

[Claim: Mining drives up household electricity bills](https://preview.redd.it/m0ta2tae4xb81.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=8079d16b0fde7bc74ebd204d4362ff823da26d3f)

Surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices, but mining? 

[Since June 2020, Natural gas prices have gone up by 350&#37; in the USA \(Henry Hub natural gas futures rolling contracts\)](https://preview.redd.it/iprxvhfj5xb81.jpg?width=2610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4da2516b82eb585706d4d1af417320b5b82889e)

[Not just in USA, in UK, natural gas is at decadal highs. ](https://preview.redd.it/v2gl6rmx3xb81.jpg?width=3094&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dae03fee6dfbbfaf58df82519db809462d01254)

Surely, electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation, or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs.. but is due to bitcoin mining?!

Crude oil WTI futures are currently at 84, for comparison it was around 56 in Nov 2019 (pre pandemic). The last time WTI was above 80 was all the way back in 2014. Increasing crude oil natural gas prices, along with inflation that is at multi-decade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity, but its bitcoin mining that is responsible.. 

[Thats according to this study funded by Ripple in collusion with the Department of Treasury. ](https://preview.redd.it/a4z5aqnyaxb81.jpg?width=1944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6656489541bece07a0e9b83837d42345157f987c)... The same Department of Treasury headed by another well known Bitcoin hater Janet Yellen, who earned $7m as ""speaking fee"" from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle Bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity. 

Research with ""financial support"" is nothing but propaganda, especially when it's funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government. Ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders. 

Ripple has also cozied up with the likes of WEF, the very organisations Bitcoin was created as a fuck you to. [https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple)

As its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated, Ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up. As usual, they will fail. 

The narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in NY is rubbish, as the largest BTC mining companies in New York produce their own energy. Infact the last one to start mining in NY is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years, before they started mining Bitcoin last year. 

[https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php)

The other large mining company Greenidge Generation also produces its own energy.


Edit: Buttcoin losers in comments say ""reee bitcoin move to POS or govt will ban it""

Yeah not too bright, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button.

Another one who is literally a war monger calling for Ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global e-waste. Lmao. Bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch


Edit: Ripple shills keep brigading and claiming where is the paper, of course if you are as bricked as a ripple fan boy you need to be spoon fed everything. Well here is the paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779720

And if you open up the first page of it, says

> **Benetton and Compiani acknowledge financial support from Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative.**

i.e this whole ""paper"" is nothing but a hit piece propaganda sponsored by a competitor

The other writer of this paper is Adiar Morse, who conveniently works for the Dept of Treasury under Yellen: 

https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/prof-adair-morse-joins-biden-administration-as-a-treasury-department-deputy/

Seems like natural career progression - collect funds from Ripple to publish propaganda against Bitcoin, and get hired by Yellen who has been promoting propaganda against crypto for years now. Nothing to see here.

Final Edit: Jjust look at the number of freshly created ""Tin"" accounts that have popped up in the comments to shill for XRP. Didnt realize 2017 left so many bag holders. It must be real miserable with these heavy bags that are at 1/3rd of their 2017 ATH, while almost every other coin has gone up hundreds of % and made new highs this cycle. Thats what happens when you become exit liquidity for mccaleb, garlinghouse etc. 

Lol at the shills shouting ""REEE ripple is a company XRP is decentralised token"". They really did you good with this one small trick. 
Thats also the reason garlinhouse drives a shiny car while you are down 50% on your shitcoin investment. 

The D in XRP stands for decentralised. It was always a premined scam token and will always be one. Thousands of tin bagholders wont change this.","ripple is funding propaganda against bitcoin by teaming up with the government to spread energy fud ripple labs has been funding research along with government entities to spread propaganda against bitcoin and mining 

in  they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in new york has increased by  per month because of mining 

claim mining drives up household electricity bills

surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices but mining 

since june  natural gas prices have gone up by  in the usa henry hub natural gas futures rolling contracts

not just in usa in uk natural gas is at decadal highs 

surely electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs but is due to bitcoin mining

crude oil wti futures are currently at  for comparison it was around  in nov  pre pandemic the last time wti was above  was all the way back in  increasing crude oil natural gas prices along with inflation that is at multidecade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity but its bitcoin mining that is responsible 

thats according to this study funded by ripple in collusion with the department of treasury  the same department of treasury headed by another well known bitcoin hater janet yellen who earned m as speaking fee from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity 

research with financial support is nothing but propaganda especially when its funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders 

ripple has also cozied up with the likes of wef the very organisations bitcoin was created as a fuck you to 

as its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up as usual they will fail 

the narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in ny is rubbish as the largest btc mining companies in new york produce their own energy infact the last one to start mining in ny is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years before they started mining bitcoin last year 



the other large mining company greenidge generation also produces its own energy


edit buttcoin losers in comments say reee bitcoin move to pos or govt will ban it

yeah not too bright the whole point of bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button

another one who is literally a war monger calling for ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global ewaste lmao bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch


edit ripple shills keep brigading and claiming where is the paper of course if you are as bricked as a ripple fan boy you need to be spoon fed everything well here is the paper 

and if you open up the first page of it says

 benetton and compiani acknowledge financial support from ripples university blockchain research initiative

ie this whole paper is nothing but a hit piece propaganda sponsored by a competitor

the other writer of this paper is adiar morse who conveniently works for the dept of treasury under yellen 



seems like natural career progression  collect funds from ripple to publish propaganda against bitcoin and get hired by yellen who has been promoting propaganda against crypto for years now nothing to see here

final edit jjust look at the number of freshly created tin accounts that have popped up in the comments to shill for xrp didnt realize  left so many bag holders it must be real miserable with these heavy bags that are at rd of their  ath while almost every other coin has gone up hundreds of  and made new highs this cycle thats what happens when you become exit liquidity for mccaleb garlinghouse etc 

lol at the shills shouting reee ripple is a company xrp is decentralised token they really did you good with this one small trick 
thats also the reason garlinhouse drives a shiny car while you are down  on your shitcoin investment
