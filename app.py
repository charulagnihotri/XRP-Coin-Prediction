st.title("üìà XRP Crypto Futures Price Prediction")

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction**
st.markdown("""
### **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict the **future prices of XRP cryptocurrency** based on past trends as seen on CoinGecko, sentiment scores of the reddit posts, and moving averages. Using **Random Forest Regression**, we analyze market data and attempt to forecast prices to help traders make informed decisions for Futures Trading.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ About XRP & Futures Trading**
st.markdown("""
### **What is XRP?**
XRP is a cryptocurrency designed for fast and low-cost cross-border transactions, developed by Ripple Labs. It is widely used in remittances and institutional payments.

### **What is Futures Trading?**
Futures trading allows investors to speculate on the future price of an asset. Unlike spot trading, futures contracts let traders **buy or sell at a predetermined price**, which can lead to higher profits or losses.
""")

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Methodology**
st.markdown("""
### **üîç Methodology**
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical XRP prices from CoinGecko, and sentiment scores of Reddit posts.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Scale data and generate sequence data.
3. **Model Training**: Train a **Random Forest Regression** model on historical trends.
4. **Evaluation**: Compare predictions with actual prices and analyze model performance.

st.title("üìä Model Performance Evaluation")

# Compute model evaluation metrics
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score

mae = mean_absolute_error(Y_test, Y_pred)
mse = mean_squared_error(Y_test, Y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
r2 = r2_score(Y_test, Y_pred)

# Optimal Scores (Benchmarking)
optimal_mae = 0  # Should be closer to 0
optimal_mse = 0   # Should be closer to 0
optimal_rmse = 0  # Should be closer to 0
optimal_r2 = 1    # Should be closer to 1

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Explanation of Evaluation Metrics**
st.markdown("""
### **üîπ Understanding Model Evaluation Metrics**
1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. Lower is better.
2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Similar to MAE but squares the differences, penalizing larger errors.
3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of MSE, keeping units consistent with the target variable.
4. **R-Squared (R¬≤) Score**: Measures how well the model explains the variance in data. Higher is better.

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: `{mae:.4f}`
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: `{mse:.4f}`

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion**
st.markdown("""
### **üèÜ Conclusion**
While the model can predict XRP price trends, its accuracy is currently limited. The **negative R¬≤ score** suggests that the model does not explain variance well, and improvements in **feature engineering** or using an **LSTM model** might yield better results.
