Doesnt mean I know anything.

It is my belief that at some point, just like every other market, there will be a bust/selection period where 99% of projects become worthless. Of the remaining survivors, maybe 5-6 take up 80-85% of the market share, 5-6 take up 5-10% and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 5-10%

Example: Theres Verizon, Att, T mobile at the top, then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile, then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about. There are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries. Tons of tv companies, 5-6 that people know, dozens that we dont, 100s of other ones, and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place.

This is what will happen IMO because it always does, since forever.

And while I dont really care if youre a fan of the US or not, the US is the strongest economy in the world, and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the US and global narrative. Im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world, but I think it's ignorant to outright say it wont matter.

With the US and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve, its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future.

I believe this is also why we have the Dino/US coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like Hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators, meeting with senators, getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us. Founders have all recently met, are all ISO 20022 compliant, and are all going nuts. I think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and I just want people to be aware of it. These projects **XLM XRP ADA HBAR ALGO** are outperforming a lot of other coins and I believe this is why, despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened.

I am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if I had just kept my money where I had it 7 years ago in these Dino coins (in XRP and ADA anyways), id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects. Look at the narrative, research it, and make an educated guess. Do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out, because it will at some point in the not so distant future.","i hope people can see whats happening with us based cryptos and bitcoin crypto investor since  made good money enough to quit my job in my mid s and travel and start a business and do other things i want with my life doesnt mean i know anything

Hello everyone, especially those who are into technical analysis. I was looking at the daily zoomed-out price chart for XRP on trading view. I noticed that there appears to be a head and shoulders pattern ranging between the December 1st, 2024 and February 25, 2025. Measuring from the top of the head to the neckline, the measured move down appears to be to $1.07. There is a candle wick that goes below the neckline, but the actual candle is well above it. Is this a valid head and shoulders pattern?","valid head and shoulders pattern on xrp

Lately all over social media, Again the buzz has been going around as follows: 

The U.S. government could theoretically benefit from buying XRP at $10,000 per token for several reasons, as outlined in speculative theories. 

Global Financial Dominance: By acquiring XRP and pegging its price at $10,000, the U.S. could establish XRP as a global reserve asset. This would allow the U.S. to maintain influence over international financial systems even in a post-dollar era.

Market Stability and Manipulation Prevention: A fixed price for XRP would reduce the risk of market manipulation by foreign powers like China. Even large-scale dumps of XRP would not affect its value below the benchmark price, safeguarding the financial system from potential economic warfare.

Blockchain Driven Economy: XRP‚Äôs use in instant settlements and tokenized assets could support a blockchain-based financial ecosystem. This would modernize the economy and facilitate transactions at a massive scale.

Leverage Through Treasury Bills (T-Bills): Instead of paying cash, the government could use T-Bills for the purchase, which Ripple could hold as reserves, collateral, or sell for liquidity. This approach strengthens the U.S. dollar‚Äôs relevance while transitioning to a blockchain-based economy.

Setting a Global Standard: A fixed XRP price endorsed by institutions like the IMF or Federal Reserve could force other nations to adopt this valuation or risk being excluded from global financial markets.

Arguments of XRP reaching astronomical amounts been buzzing around again and now over speculations of the Gov. swapping Tbills for Ripple's escrow triggering astronomical price growth...

So Why again does this happen time and again? Speculation (and also white paper research) done on XRP reaching into the thousands???
