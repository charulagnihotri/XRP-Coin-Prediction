"Be honest, did I miss the XRP boat?","Last time I made money in crypto I grew $8K into $80k. timing was right. Got in early. Got out before a correction. Have been in traditionalIndex  ETFs ever since. 

Friend and colleague both recommended XRP last year. They had invested the year prior and earlier. Both had gains but had experienced a fair amount of fluctuation but we're very bullish. I  told myself I'd do my own homework and if it looked good, I would invest $10k. 

I didn't. I'm kicking myself. 

Is it too late? Is the Trump bull run little more than a ""sell the news""event?

Convince me that Ripple (XRP) is not a Ponzi Scheme…,"Out of all the big players in the crypto landscape, Ripple stands out to me as a Charlatan.

A for profit company that is trying to get banks and central banks to adopt its currency. Banks and central banks will be the last to adopt crypto and will only adopt something that the masses use.

This company only has a billion dollars in cash, has 1100 employees, and the rest of its assets, purportedly 25 billion, is in mostly ripple.

So essentially anytime the price goes up they are incentivized to sell Ripple from the balance sheet to help cover cost. What I don’t get is the ripple market cap is suppose to be 27 billion on top of all this per coin-market-cap.

What am I missing here?",310,1719817739.0,2024-07-01

> US judge rules Ripple $XRP is not a security.

And damn market really took notice. XRP just had a 20 percent green candle in a matter of few minutes. Actually most of crypto has gone up suddenly few percent in top 100 after the news of this has arrived which is pretty bullish for cryptos in general.

So congrats to all the XRP holders, and unfortunately even though I'm not the one I'm glad for XRP success because success in this ruling might mean a huge win for all the cryptos overall... All of the cryptos in top 100 have took a huge notice since this ruling has been publicly declared, so good to see.",3486,1689262880.0,2023-07-13

**EDIT 5:** Huge shoutout to the /r/cryptocurrency mods. You guys are amazing.

Me and a few friends tried to warn them but with all the Wallstreetbets and GME hype, it allowed a ton of crypto newcomers who didn't know what a ""pump and dump"" scheme is to get scammed.

This comes right after the large doge dump.

The worst part is, their moderators made no efforts to remove posts related to the scam. It is reported that /u/nvok (a moderator of /r/Ripple and /r/XRP) and fellow moderators were allowing the scam to be promoted and were removing posts that were negative towards it. They also ban any users that critique Ripple or XRP (the token of Ripple). It is unknown if they were involved in the scam, but it is evident they failed to educate their users.

Feel free to **report both of those subreddits** by contacting reddit admins. You can find any post in /r/Ripple or /r/XRP and report it via the reddit contact us page as there is no other direct way to report a subreddit. They, /u/nvok and other moderators need to be investigated.",11357,1612187906.0,2021-02-01

Then when you check the comments, people are all asking her why she called XRP a scam in the call.  

A commenter wrote: ""A caller asked the question about what she thought about ripple and xrp, and she said she doesn't like it, it isn't a commodity, and it was more like a scam.""

"I made $458,000 in a flash crash buying XRP at 0.00004USDT each, then the exchange reversed the trades and took my profits","The story goes like this…

If you go onto the XRP/USDT pairing on LAToken and scroll back to the 23rd February you can see the price dropped to 0.00004USDT per XRP. I had placed very low limit orders prior to this that have since been filled.

When I logged into my account after placing these low bids on the market a while back, I was amazed to see I had amassed 632,151 XRP tokens.

Here’s the heart-breaking bit. I naturally was mind-blown, so I tried to sell some of the XRP in the account then withdraw my profits from the exchange elsewhere, only to have the withdrawal declined and my account temporarily closed for 1 day siting a ‘violation of our terms of use’. I have done nothing wrong and simply set low limit orders that were filled.

I contacted support asking why this has happened, they didn’t tell me why my account was restricted or what terms of use I had broken. After the 24 hours my account is back up, all the XRP is gone and I’m left with the cryptocurrency I had originally. I contact support again asking for my coins back, I get vague responses not related to the issue.

Binance is not holding verifiable proof of reserves for ETH/XRP in the BNB ecosystem and is failing to hold adequate reserves / or show reserves for most of its other cryptos. They only verify that they hold 30% of the ADA in the BNB ecosystem.,"Please also check the edit at the bottom for an update regarding lack of proof of reserves on the stables on BNB as well:

**TLDR:** Binance fails to provide adequate proof of reserves for assets in the BNB chain. Binance encourages users to withdraw their crypto into the Binance ecosystem by charging higher fees to withdraw into native ecosystems - and are failing to Provide Proof of Assets altogether or a sufficient amount in their Proof of Assets for the crypto in the Binance ecosystem. This gives Binance a huge opportunity to manipulate the crypto market by creating ""fake crypto tokens"" in the BNB ecosystem that are not backed by any underlying asset and then selling/using your assets. Furthermore, it pushes volume into BNB chain by encouraging withdraws into the BNB ecosystem that may end up not backed by any assets....

**What you need to know**

* [BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2 tokens) and BNB Smart Chain (BEP20 tokens) are two native chains of the Binance ecosystem](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/854415cf3d214371a7b60cf01ead0918). Binance allows users to withdraw lots of different crypto as tokens into their native chains which then allows users the ability to use ""those assets"" in the Binance ecosystem.
* As you can imagine, this could create a few concerns... The largest being Binance could sell/send the underlying asset of the BEP2/20 Tokens as the user no longer holds the true crypto but a token on the Binance ecosystem, essentially allowing them to manipulate the total supply of those cryptos by creating ""fake BNB tokens"" with no actual backing on the native chain.
* To ease concerns about artificial manipulation Binance began providing [Proof of Asset](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof) wallets where, for crosschain assets (Ether, XRP, ADA, Doge, etc..) they should theoretically hold an underlying asset equal to the amount of the asset that is in the BEP2/20 ecosystem. This is supposed to ensure the Binance asset you are holding is backed by an equal amount on its native chain and the supply is not being artificially manipulated.
   * The problem however is they do not provide a Proof of Asset list for most of their assets in the Binance ecosystem. Additionally of those that have a Proof of Asset wallet, most are not fully backed or actually list no real backing at all.
      * The [LTC proof of reserve address](https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/MQSs17ECe51kqhkFPQY98wiyPvGuK5iCB6) holds 745K LTC. However there are 857k LTC in the BNB ecosystem - 725k in the [BEP20 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x4338665cbb7b2485a8855a139b75d5e34ab0db94) and 132k in the [BEP2 addresses](https://explorer.bnbchain.org/asset/LTC-F07) \-  **87% backed**
      * THE [ADA proof of reserve](https://explorer.cardano.org/en/address?address=addr1q8hsff3uwtphx7dtya7unjwjwug52e5jvqp09je6pwqx8k4jvuxrw2x5rr7e258a33yzkrhhlrrc5ezvd2z7qtdq0gasme44c9) address holds 200M ADA. However there are 672M ADA in the BNB ecosystem - 241M circulating in [BEP20 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47) and 431M circulating in [BEP2 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47) \- **29.7% backed**
      * (very concerning) The following is the [listed](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof) proof of asset address [for ETHER](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9BF4001d307dFd62B26A2F1307ee0C0307632d59). It's supposed to hold all of the ETHER on the BNB ecosystem but it currently sits at .017 ETH and the ETHER was moved to [this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf977814e90da44bfa03b6295a0616a897441acec), labeled as Binance 8. The BNB ETHER reserves were comingled with non-BNB reserve ether, meaning you can't verify how much the BNB Ether is backed verse regular user funds. - **0% verifiably backed**
      * (very concerning and easier to understand) The [XRP](https://xrpscan.com/account/rJpj1Mv21gJzsbsVnkp1U4nqchZbmZ9pM5) proof of reserves wallet for the BNB Chain is just as bad as the ETHER but since it doesn't show any tokens **it's easier to see how bad it is**. It holds a total of 10 XRP. The rest was transferred to [this wallet](https://xrpscan.com/account/rs8ZPbYqgecRcDzQpJYAMhSxSi5htsjnza) \- a general Binance wallet for XRP, which interacts with [this wallet](https://xrpscan.com/account/rDAE53VfMvftPB4ogpWGWvzkQxfht6JPxr) \- the withdrawal address for users of XRP. Again all XRP in the BNB reserves have been comingled with regular user funds not in BNB. with no way to verify they hold sufficient XRP in the BNB chain. - **0% verifiably backed**

\-----------------------------------------------------

Binance lists 35 different crypto assets in their [Proof of Assets Page](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof), however in the top 200 cryptos by market cap, over 80 of them can be withdrawn as BEP2/20 tokens. Meaning there are at least 45 cryptos assets that do not have any sort of ""proof of asset"" listed. The total number of unbacked assets is even higher, as there are assets above 200+ by marketcap that can be withdrawn into the Binance ecosystem.

Even for assets that have a proof of reserve listed that doesn't mean it is adequately backed or backed at all. For example; ETH ERC2/20 tokens have no verifiable backing, XRP ERC2/20 tokens have no verifiable backing, ADA ERC2/20 tokens are 29.7% backed. LTC ERC2/20 tokens are 86.9% backed and those are just a few of the listed assets that I checked.

\----------------------------

**Complications**: This problem has been unchecked and inflated since, I posted about this issue [6 months ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uz09wu/binance_is_encouraging_withdrawingminting_your/). Since then XRP and ETHER have lost all verifiable backing and ADA backing dropped from 71% to \~30%.

It continues to be compounded by the fact that Binance encourages users to send their crypto into BEP 2/20 tokens by making it more expensive to send the asset into the native chain. As an example Dogecoin costs 1.94 Doge to withdraw as a BEP 2/20 token and 5 Doge to withdraw into the native Dogecoin network. This is standard practice for [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee)/[BinanceUS](https://www.binance.us/en/fee/schedule) for nearly all assets available to withdrawal into the Binance ecosystem, and the unbacked assets will likely continue to grow if left unchecked.

If the last few weeks haven't made it clear yet, the last people left holding unbacked assets end up with nothing.

# Edit:

As pointed out by [another user](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yxxugl/comment/iwrfyhd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Binance also no longer has proof of reserves of the **PAXD or the USDC stablecoin** both of which are still circulating in the BNB ecosystem. Both appear to have been comingled with regular user funds in the Binance 8 wallet (link below).

PAXD [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8e870d67f660d95d5be530380d0ec0bd388289e1?a=0x47ac0Fb4F2D84898e4D9E7b4DaB3C24507a6D503)

Why do people still invest in XRP?,"Genuine question. It has been an under performer since the high in the 2017 bull run, since then it hasn’t been able to make new highs. The btc/xrp chart is literally down on Btc after 10 years, ripple labs is known to continuously unload tokens onto the market keeping the price down.

I was heavily invested in 2018-2019 when I entered the market but then ended up selling it all into eth which was a really great move, since then I haven’t looked back. 

Why do you guys still believe in xrp?? I don’t get it, it’s never a good sign when a coin can’t break its previous highs in a bull run. And you can’t entirely blame that on the SEC case, even without it I don’t think it would’ve gone much higher as payment solutions was not a narrative that got much attention that cycle.. and this cycle coming up I just don’t see people coming in getting hyped about xrp.

It just doesn’t stand out in any facet and I argue its time in the top 10 is coming to an end, it’s still hovering around the same price it was over 5 years ago when I entered the market. You’d be better off with most stocks at this point. what is the reason you’d pick xrp as an investment?? I just get so confused when people still think it’s a good addition to a portfolio

Edit: I actually agree with the people saying this sub is like the best reverse-indicator and I've used it before on the Solana bottom when it was being fudded hard by this sub. That being said I've heard 100s of 'XRP to the moon next week!' or 'SWIFT adoption $589 XRP in 1 month!' videos over the last 5 years and XRP has never performed, I actually hope you XRP holders are right and it moons.. I just don't see it. I'll revisit this later on in the bull market and lets see how XRP has faired to the rest of the market. It will go up with the rest of the market for sure, like it always does. I just think it will be an under-performer compared to other coins. Good luck XRP army! I'm not a hater just think it's a bad pick for a bull market",619,1706660584.0,2024-01-31

How crypto online is ever taken seriously when you can’t tell the difference between a crypto news article on YouTube to some 12 year old kids Fortnite upload when both thumbnails look exactly the same. With emoji, stupid fonts, shocked cum faces...

Anyway, I was looking up for some credible analysis channels on any platforms and couldn't find many, other than Crypto Dad (pretty basic though) and chain specific c suite people on Twitter. 

I'm not looking for coin shillers or moonshot bullshitting TA 'analyst' more news and educational speculation.

XRP got much more love than they deserve - Ripple is heavily centralized and fights real decentralization in the crypto space,"During the SEC lawsuit, I have noticed XRP getting a lot of love from the crypto community, and I can understand this. The SEC was never only going against Ripple as we have seen this year, so this entire lawsuit was somehow representative for all of crypto.

However now that things are somehow settled, we should face reality: XRP is just another heavily centralized project, no matter if it's a security or not. The consensus mechanism is literally proof of trust - The network runs on a bunch of bank owned servers, relying on all participants being doxxed. This is not innovative blockchain tech, this is the same old banking system using ""blockchain"" as a marketing term.

I could live with that alone or ignore it at least - XRP it's by far not the only centralized cryptocurrency. However Ripple has also done their best in the past to fight real decentralized cryptos like BTC and ETH:

They often attack BTC, for example Ripple CFO claimed BTC is controlled by China in 2020 ([source](https://gizmodo.com/ripple-claims-bitcoin-is-chinese-controlled-while-annou-1845932148)). The same claims were made against Ethereum according to Vitalik Buterin ([source](https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-faults-ripples-decentralization-claim-says-the-platform-is-completely-centralized/)), for which they never apologized.

Also most of you probably remember they funded a FUD energy campaign that tried to push Bitcoin towards PoS ([source](https://decrypt.co/96298/ripple-co-founder-backs-controversial-campaign-change-bitcoin-code)).

&#x200B;

At this point people should really think twice if that's a project they want to support just because there is some bullish outlook after they won the case. Ripple is not using, but abusing ""blockchain"" - and they are certainly not your friends.",533,1690892005.0,2023-08-01

The SEC completely bluffed the Xrp lawsuit and got caught out showing their biggest hand.,"The SEC is getting completely bodied up now and the fight is becoming very very one sided. The sec has bad facts on their side and the recent rulings against the emails showed the SEC’s biggest hand.

They had another delay tactic up their sleeve to prevent handing over the emails but this would have resulted in a binding ruling setting precedent. 


The SEC does NOT want to risk any ruling that results in precedent going against them. 

They handed over the emails. 

So right now this lawsuit is wrapping up, final submissions are being made and the SEC’s argument is very weak. Multiple amicus briefs are being submitted in support of Ripple. Some of these completely destroy the SEC’s argument and highlight the fact they are not protecting investors.

So as we reach the pointy end, the SEC won’t leave this in the judges hands, even if they do then they have to deal with the fair notice defence. If those emails are as damaging as the Ripple team say, expect settlement. 

They are not willing to risk it for the biscuit.",608,1667040483.0,2022-10-29

"Don't be this guy: Tiktokker mortgaged his house to ""invest"" (read: gamble) $500K in XRP in February 2022 - Despite a 103% pump off the bear market low, he is still down 33%","Money\_talk\_tok is a Tiktokker with 56.5K followers

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r36dc4o2ce2b1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=27a9fa7c09c886cb9fac73dbcc3bc80120273f15

&#x200B;

Money\_talk\_tok announced on 24 February 2022 that he bet his house on XRP when XRP was around $0.69 (nice). The amount was $500K. He did that ""because there is so much fear in the market. Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy"". Yes this is a literal quote from the video.

https://preview.redd.it/3sakchq67e2b1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9407aa4bea91e8fcc69b1f8ac9fa158b3c78b87

His rationale for buying was based on the Fear & Greed Index because the market was at complete fear. Even though back then the Fear & Greed index was ""only"" at 23.

His ""investment"" went up initially, but then dropped 59% from the point of buying XRP, meaning that his $500K through mortaging his house was worth $205K 114 days later.

https://preview.redd.it/nedswkqv9e2b1.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfb397417bc412507a86c2a20f25fc0089af39ee

Right now, he is still down about 33% from his initial investment, even if XRP saw a 103% pump off the lows, which now retraced some again. Through in his words ""have I lost money? No I havent, because I havent sold"". 1 XRP = 1 XRP in his mind.

Why on earth would someone do this!?

Both my dad and my friend are happy now and I hope I can use this experience to get them onside with bitcoin and ethereum in the future.

It's crazy to think about XRP which was sued by the SEC Dec. 22nd 2020. Prior to the suit XRP was ranked #3 by marketcap and had a price of $.53 after the lawsuit was announced the price dropped more than 50% in in less 24 hours dropping to \~$.25 by Dec. 23rd 2020.

But XRP keeps chugging along, with the price currently at $.47, XRP is hanging out around its pre lawsuit price, and it's marketcap is currently above the prelawsuit marketcap - due to an increase in the circulating supply.

Despite the ongoing SEC suit and a bear market - XRP is firmly cemented as #6 in marketcap and doesn't appear to be going anywhere.

All of the XRP ruling gains have officially been erased.,"Basically all the altcoin gains that followed successful XRP ruling have been erased these last few days, but now officially even XRP's huge gains have also been erased. After it was ruled by judge Torres that XRP is not a security XRP's price went almost instantly from 48 cents to 81 cent and now at this moment price is back to levels of 48 cents just a month later.

Altcoins like Polygon that went up after the ruling from 72 cents to 85 cents are down in much deeper red than before the ruling by leveling at barely 57 cents right now meaning Matic is down 21% since even before XRP ruling gains. Only top 50 altcoin that has its price still slightly higher than prior to XRP ruling is XLM which was on 10 cents prior to ruling, and now it is treading around 11 cents, but even that could be erased very soon considering the constant downshift towards the bottom.

Algo that also had a positive bump of around 20% following the XRP ruling has now retested its new all time bottom at just 9 cents. So Algo dumped since then even more than others considering it is now officially out of top 50 coins on coingecko by marketcap.",229,1692338584.0,2023-08-18

"Nasdaq Files to List XRP ETF, Stating XRP Is Hard to Manipulate","Article in summary:
Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to list the Coinshares XRP ETF, arguing that XRP’s decentralized structure and deep liquidity make it difficult to manipulate. The ETF will function as a Delaware Statutory Trust, holding only XRP and cash, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP without direct ownership.

Key points from the filing:

•	⁠The ETF’s value will track the Compass Crypto Reference Index XRP (4 PM NY time).
•	⁠XRP will be securely stored by a third-party custodian to ensure safety.
•	⁠Nasdaq argues that XRP is less prone to manipulation than other digital assets previously approved for ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
•	⁠The SEC is now reviewing the proposal and seeking public comments before making a decision.

This move could significantly impact XRP’s market adoption, providing regulated institutional access to the asset and potentially increasing trading volumes. If approved, this ETF could mark a major milestone in XRP’s journey toward mainstream financial integration.

Message to everyone who was a victim to the recent XRP pump and dump scheme.,"For those who don't know, there was a telegram group with over 100k members all telling people to buy XRP and hold on feb 1st. This spread like crazy, I had family members asking me if they should buy XRP and hold on monday.

[Proof of group](https://preview.redd.it/dfe8q79phve61.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=d51630f806ab068caafa7d1f02c6c1b0d25a71e4)

&#x200B;

Heres the result... 40% dump in a few hours leading up to the time the group was telling people to hold till.

If you were a victim to this pump and dump, I'm sorry for your losses. This is a tough life lesson for anyone new to investing. I don't mean to rub salt in the wound but this could be seen from a mile away, pump telegram channels ALWAYS have the exact same outcome. It's important you understand this to avoid getting burned in the future.

How did this get so big?

The GME movement has set off a chain reaction throughout all global markets and this pump and dump was perfectly timed to disguise itself as another revolution.

Unfortunately the XRP pump and dump is almost the exact opposite, XRP is given out for free to huge businesses and celebrities who agree to a public partnership. Instead of screwing over the rich. You just pumped their bangs and gave them a decent amount of volume to dump into before the lawsuit.",532,1612188315.0,2021-02-01

STOP Crypto Reserve: XRP's Satoshi (Chris Larsen) already sold 100M$ USD worth of XRP in 2025,"EDIT: Because people see my @ and make wrong assumptions: I am personally against any crypto reserve, also against a Bitcoin reserve. 

While many XRP believers are hoping for a crypto reserve, Chris Larsen, one of the founders of Ripple has sold around 100M USD worth of XRP in 2025 alone. He owns almost 3 billion XRP and they are all unlocked. He basically owns more than Satoshi of the circulating supply (percentage wise), and is free to dump them whenever he wants. 

This is his address: https://xrpscan.com/account/rhREXVHV938ToGkdJQ9NCYEY4x8kSEtjna

You can easily see that some he transfered directly to Coinbase, other transactions first go to the address rPS9kVPbgZF4vXq2hs6s9Xv2754qdRau98 and then to rnQXgGAjqbF4KoBpcBK5YBHyZEL7nGWWoi and from there to rHnx565xVcKadSuxJbAHXv9QSj6ANVRMUB. From here they go to Bybit and Bitstamp.

Please help spread this information. We have to stop a crypto reserve! I don't care, he can enrich himself all he wants, but this is a danger to the United States of America. 

We have to act. We have to make this public information. ",0,1738068817.0,2025-01-28

"Ripple’s XRP soars 30% - why you should be supporting Ripple, regardless of your opinion on XRP","I’m sure most of you here have seen XRP’s staggering performance today. The reason for this post is because most people on this sub dislike XRP due to its centralised nature. However, the following reason - in my opinion - is why everyone should be cheering for Ripple in the ongoing lawsuit, no matter your opinion on XRP.

Let’s face it, XRP holders have had a rough few years after the lawsuit was announced in December 2020. However, as the years have gone on, we have seen countless amazing projects enter and drop out of the top 10 - Chainlink, Monero, Tezos - to name a few. Guess which coin has amazingly retained its top 10 spot, despite having the SEC on its back? You guessed it: XRP.

Regardless of whether you hold, love or hate XRP, Ripple are doing what pretty much all of us would love to do, and that’s give a huge middle finger to the SEC. One must realise that an SEC victory will put so many other projects under scrutiny, and this will not favour crypto well as a whole. We will witness many of our favourite projects being placed under the microscope of the regulators. However, if the lawsuit ends with a Ripple victory, it may potentially set up crypto for a (mini) bull run, as regulators are forced to lay off as we see some sort of regulatory clarity in our beloved industry. The crypto industry as a whole is likely to piggy-back off the success of the lawsuit, should we see a favourable victory. No one wants to be in Ripple’s position, but I’m sure we can all appreciate that Ripple has taken one for the team and is fighting one of the most important battles - not just for themselves, but for the entire crypto industry.

"XRP news abound this week! Former Ripple chair Barr Confirmed as new Fed Chief, Judge Netburn named the SEC 'hypocrites' in ruling, McCaleb (XLM) dumping nearly done. Whew!","My goodness friends, what a week for Ripple. XRP holders, catalysts abound yet we remain stuck in by the bears. Let's do a quick recap anyway, and hope that the market begins to reflect the bullish news:

Michael Barr Confirmed: Michael Barr, a former Ripple adviser, is set to assume one of the most important U.S. regulatory roles after winning Senate confirmation to be vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve. Barr is considered an ally to crypto, but has tempered his sentiments with expectations that the market be regulated robustly. This appointment is widely considered good for crypto, and considering it's issues with the SEC - good for Ripple.

Netburn says 'the Hinman emails must be produced': The long awaited ruling has finally come down from Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn regarding the attorney-client privilege of conversations had with SEC lawyers by William Hinman. Judge Netburn unequivocally ruled in favor of Ripple, even slamming the 'hypocrisy' of the SEC in its attempted defense - asserting that the SEC isn't even attempting to follow the law in good faith. In his now infamous speech Hinman said that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not to be considered securities, despite ETH having conducted the same kind of unregistered token offerings as Ripple. The preperatory emails Hinman exchanged with SEC lawyers have been desperately guarded to this point, and it remains to be seen what the SEC will do. It seems likely that there will be a series of appeals to Judge Analise Torres, who is responsible for ruling on any appeals to Judge Netburn's decisions.

Jed's dead baby: Former Ripple CTO Jed McCaleb is almost done selling his 9 billion XRP after nearly 8 years. Jed left Ripple after having differences with the leadership team on the direction of the project there. Jed has since worked to bring Stellar (XLM) into the crypto space as a competitor to Ripple within the global payment settlement industry. It is believed that Jed has nearly completed selling his stack of XRP, (he holds approximately 10 million in his TacoStand account) which is estimated to be gone by weeks end. XRP fans are ecstatic about this, as the downward selling pressure has been significant from McCaleb for nearly a decade.

Other notes: Did you know that Ripple only controls about 5% of nodes on the XRPL? XRP is more decentralized than many crypto projects. The community drives most innovations on chain as well, and will soon deliver Smart Contracts to XRPL in a 100% community driven effort, minus any Ripple devs. Congrats!

Much to be excited for if you hold a bag of XRP. Thanks for reading!",318,1657802262.0,2022-07-14
XRP: Fomo or Truth?,"
Hi guys,

after yesterday’s news XRP has gotten up 12% and I was wondering whether (in case it gets finally approved) XRP could do a 10x/100x or just do an Ethereum.

I’m kinda new to altcoins (previously lost 85% on memecoins) and was wondering whether the reports were true or just XRP holders looking into getting exit liquidity.

I, a few months back, saw something similar for SOL after the mini crash/market correction and it went up 40%. 

I do obviously understand that there is some exaggeration by the XRP holders. But just to know whether it’s a meme-intended exaggeration or a realistic/ possible outcome.

Thanks to anyone who answers!v

"People often claim that XRP is deflationary, but it is not. Every year the circulation supply increases, so XRP's supply is inflationary","I hold XRP. I believe it will appreciate in price. But I am not blind to its faults and there some misinformation here because people claim that XRP has no inflation and is deflationary:

https://preview.redd.it/9vmgajo1pyab1.png?width=1085&format=png&auto=webp&s=30baabb79b82a2d2d30cc0e55a8042abf86feef2

This idea also gets posted on news websites sometimes from a different perspective because every now and then XRP gets burned.

And while it is true that all XRP might be pre-mined and capped at 100 billion, we have definitely seen plenty of inflation, meaning that there is quite a lot of inflation in the supply:

* Supply 25 June 2017: 38,291,387,790
* Supply 24 June 2018: 39,245,304,677
* Supply 23 June 2019: 42,501,950,124
* Supply 28 June 2020: 44,257,803,618
* Supply 25 June 2021: 46,265,302,471
* Supply 24 June 2022: 48,343,101,197
* Supply 25 June 2023: 52,254,289,650

**That is a 33.85% increase in 6 years!** 

This supply inflation is actually rather high (though partly offset by the burns):

But let's face it. That's like USD having 50% of its supply hidden that gets slowly released (inflating the supply of USD) and then claiming its not inflation because that 50% hidden supply was already ""pre-mined"". Thats not how it works.

Fact is, XRP's circulating supply increases over time. Not as much as other tokens like Immutable, Gala, Sand, and Mana. But plenty to make a difference. And Ripple dumps that XRP on users. A bit every year.",188,1688918886.0,2023-07-09

We need to have a serious talk about Marketcaps. ,"On the XRP sub and other places filled with XRP Maxis, people are saying XRP is going to hit $100 as if it's a very real and very feasible target for the community. Let's talk about what exactly that would look like. XRP has a circulating supply of 57B. At a price of $100 each that would put the marketcap of XRP at $5.7T. OVER 3X the current marketcap of BTC, and this doesn't even consider the inevitable increase in circulating supply as time passes.

Look I get it, it's fun to dream about 25x (or 250x gains for people talking about XRP to $1,000 - I'm dead serious people are talking about this) but don't let those dreams cause you to make bad investment decisions.

\---------

**You want to know what other community was talking about having a $5.9T marketcap in 2021?** In 2021 Shiba Inu to $.01 was all the rage as people swore that it was a realistic and feasible target for the meme token and many made terrible investment decisions as a result swearing that Shiba Inu was going to hit $.01. Looking at Shiba Inu now it's.... not even close to it's 2021 ATH, and lets be clear will never hit $.01.

You're welcome to dream about crazy crypto profits but don't make bad investment decisions because of those crazy dreams.",1403,1733183629.0,2024-12-02

Why Ripple's XRP is poised for $10,"I will present the case why XRP will re-enter price discovery this year due to the very bullish chart structure. I believe that XRP is imitating Bitcoin's previous cycle from 2018-2021. Of course, this is not financial advice, you must proceed at your own caution and exercise appropriate risk management but I wanted to share my thoughts.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rsiesesy7vsc1.png?width=1593&format=png&auto=webp&s=918f22ab28ac6db98f6a9d4705e8e5e42c59de47

The image is the Bitcoin price chart during the last cycle. We see Bitcoin crash to 3k in 2018, followed by a retrace to the 0.618 retracement to 14k in 2019, then re-accumulation back down to the lows in early 2020 followed by price expansion, almost reaching a full 4.236 extension in 2021.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wju0aun18vsc1.png?width=1581&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b50d93e9f28ef43bb1520d239cc399650e0b18

This image is the XRP price chart. XRP is showing a similar structure to Bitcoin's previous cycle but just behaving much more slowly which is why most people think the project is dead, retail investors don't have much patience. We observe that XRP crashed to $0.11 in 2020, then retraced to around the 0.618 at $2 in 2021, followed by re-accumulation in 2022-23 and now I believe we are about to enter the price expansion phase. If XRP was achieve a full 4.236 extension like bitcoin, then the target would be above $10.

Both the structure of bitcoin and XRP show: crash, retrace, re-accumulation and now price expansion.

However, I would like to offer some balance as well and want to re-iterate that XRP must break the 2021 high of $2 to show confirmation of an uptrend. Otherwise, it may make another lower high and that would cause XRP to deviate away from what BTC did last cycle. This bullish thesis hinges on XRP being able to break that 2021 high, so pay close attention to that.

I also believe that 2024 will be make or break for XRP. As I expect the inevitable hard landing of the US economy in the second half of this year. It's pretty much now or never for coins like XRP. If it is unable to do anything meaningful this year, I will have to conclude the project is dead because once the macro conditions turns ugly, there is no chance for any crypto to do well in that environment. The stock market is the force that drives crypto bull runs. However, I remain hopeful that we get our XRP bull run this year.

Most people on this subreddit hate XRP which is again another reason to be bullish. The herd of retail investors is generally wrong. They all expected 100k in 2021, they all thought crypto died in 2022, they all expected 12k in 2023, they hated Solana at the lows...the list is endless. When has the herd of retail investors ever been right about anything? Now they all expect the bull run to last until late 2025 lmao.

I am a firm believer of ""show me the chart and I will tell you the news"", so I am expecting some bullish narrative to emerge for XRP, who knows. Regardless, I think we can all agree that 2024 will be pivotal for coins like XRP. Look forward to hearing your thoughts!

"ETH is bad, and I am tired of pretending it's not.","I am going to open up by saying that some of the following is going to be FACT and some of it will be OPINION. However, the opinion will never prevail over the facts. Also, depending on traction I may do a second post with some more up to debate things.  
I also know that the title alone will lead to downvotes, some of you won’t even read it before downvoting. It is a shame that people forgot downvotes are supposed to be used to penalize off-topic and not to punish unpopular opinions, not to create echo chambers.    
So let’s get to it shall we?   

**ETH is shady:**  
Not only is ETH a security, it has always been manipulated by well connected and powerful people behind the scenes. The connections between the ETH Foundation, ConsenSys, and the SEC are totally public knowledge. 
Jay Clayton, the former SEC chairman, was a partner at Sullivan and Cromwell.    
Joe Lubin, co-founder of ETH, also founded ConsenSys. He also bought 9.5% of ETH supply.   
ConsenSys is a client of Sullivan and Cromwell.  
That was the back door ETH used to get the free pass on regulations.  
There are court papers about the meetings between ConsenSys and the SEC.  
At the same time, the SEC was prosecuting DOZENS of ICOs that were using the exact same approach ETH was.  
Hinman’s, Clayton’s Director of Corporate Finance, speech where he says ETH is not a security was partly WRITTEN by some of ETH top investors.  
The plan by ConsenSys with the help of the SEC was clearly to make ETH the only crossborders payment platform by giving it a free pass, while at the same time preventing any incursion into that space with SEC lawsuits.   
At the same time this was happening, Gary Gensler told an MIT audience that “XRP deserved regulatory clarity”.  (I won’t go in depth with the Ripple lawsuit here).  
Not only is Chairman Gensler trying to pretend he never said that, and the entire SEC trying to hide the fact they gave ETH a free pass, to date ETH is the only altcoin to have had the privilege of being formally consider a commodity/currency and not a security.   
Other funny “coincidences” include: Claydon being hired by a crypto hedge fund 100% invested in BTC and ETH. SEC Enforcement Director Marc Berger being hired by Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett, part of the ETH Alliance and Hinman’s prior employer, less than a month after the Ripple lawsuit was filled. Hinman receiving $15 Million, during his service on the SEC, from  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett. AND after leaving the SEC, Hinman returned to  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett as a senior crypto adviser.  

**ETH is centralized:**  
Users and nodes have no real power to shape the protocol. This is virtually true of all protocols with a Foundation at it’s head, but we can’t forget ETH falls under this group.  
The first piece of evidence here is the ETC hard fork. This fork happened because the wrong people lost money. The changed the code and the protocol for the first time to suit the wealthy whales and not the users or miners. They changed the rules to fit their goals.    
The second piece comes in the form of changes to mining rewards. This was a blatant attempt to decrease supply by not paying the miners. More important than the way it impacts the economics of ETH, it points towards a centralisation of power. Rules can be changed on the fly with no consideration from the community but based on profits alone for the higher ups.  
This leads us to the PoS change. This has nothing to do with energy concerns or with price of fees. This is meant to skip all the intermediate problems by getting rid of miners and let the token holders leverage their will directly. Don’t forget the LUDICROUS amount of ETH that was pre-mined.  
Every hard fork the Ethereum blockchain has enacted has always been for the benefit of the few, never for the benefits of the community. You know what that looks like? Our current banking system. Where the citizens and the working class pay the price for mistakes and reap none of the rewards for profit.  
People in this sub hate central bank digital currencies, failing to see that every abuse these could enact on the public, so can Ethereum upon it’s users.    
To quote one of my sources “Etherium is not a decentralized peer-to-peer system. It is a system with an unaccountable ruling class exploiting the working class, making promises they can’t keep, while spinning a wonderful narrative.”  
  
**ETH recent and future design is bad:**  
Everyone was fooled into thinking EIP 1559 was going to be a good thing. How the Foundation pulled that off is honestly mind boggling.  
This change made it so fees were more uniform. Uniformly high. And making sure that miners saw none of that profit by burning it.   
Burning the fees essentially made sure that the biggest holders get they profits increased because every ETH is worth more, while miners that actually keep the network safe get a pay cut because there are less fees per block for them.  
But the biggest problem is that you are getting a landlorded network to users. If you want ETH to be useful, you need to, well, use it. But this model makes it so the interests of holders are opposite to the interests of users. Users want lower fees so they can use the network to transact, but holders want higher fees, for more burn and more profit.  
Taking money out of the pockets of miners decreases security. If you are paid less you have a higher incentive to get your money some other ways.   
And since users and holders have different agendas, future goals benefit different people. An interesting question would be for instance what happens in the case of a block size adjustment? Bigger or smaller block sized benefit users and holders differently.
Well, given ETH’s history, you know how those chips would fall. Even this decision was reached by a small amount of key players.  
And PoS will only make this whole process more straight forward. The fact that the token holding are already so centralized will make changes easier for the ruling class and be baked into the system.    

**In conclusion:**    
ETH’s had a shady start, has been controlled by a group of shadow players on the background, is becoming less and less secure and has no intention of not being.    
At any point, any decision can be hard forked in. The miners don’t matter. Your nodes don’t matter.  
ETH is INTENDED to shackle you the exact same way the current banking system does.    
Don’t be fooled.

Why did I fall into XRP? I should of fell more into Cardano or literally any other crypto,"Why can’t XRP go on a run? Does this little bull run or bearish run prove XRP is becoming a dead coin? When was the last time this coin went on a run? Its mid at the very best 

I should have put a little more into cardano but I fell into the XRP and XLM hype😭 The material looked great on paper!! Don’t get me wrong I tried not to put all my eggs in one, I put a little into Cardano before it blew up and other things too, 

but overall XRP and XLM are the only two coins i spent the most on, which these are the only 2 coins that are not preforming great. If it couldn’t do much on this little run, why will it blow up on any other run? Cardano and the rest are pretty much now guaranteed to do big on the next run

I hope people can see whats happening with US based cryptos and Bitcoin,"Crypto investor since 2017, made good money, enough to quit my job in my mid 30s and travel and start a business and do other things I want with my life. Doesnt mean I know anything.

It is my belief that at some point, just like every other market, there will be a bust/selection period where 99% of projects become worthless. Of the remaining survivors, maybe 5-6 take up 80-85% of the market share, 5-6 take up 5-10% and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 5-10%

Example: Theres Verizon, Att, T mobile at the top, then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile, then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about. There are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries. Tons of tv companies, 5-6 that people know, dozens that we dont, 100s of other ones, and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place.

This is what will happen IMO because it always does, since forever.

And while I dont really care if youre a fan of the US or not, the US is the strongest economy in the world, and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the US and global narrative. Im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world, but I think it's ignorant to outright say it wont matter.

With the US and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve, its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future.

I believe this is also why we have the Dino/US coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like Hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators, meeting with senators, getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us. Founders have all recently met, are all ISO 20022 compliant, and are all going nuts. I think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and I just want people to be aware of it. These projects **XLM XRP ADA HBAR ALGO** are outperforming a lot of other coins and I believe this is why, despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened.

I am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if I had just kept my money where I had it 7 years ago in these Dino coins (in XRP and ADA anyways), id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects. Look at the narrative, research it, and make an educated guess. Do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out, because it will at some point in the not so distant future.",1176,1732914715.0,2024-11-29

Even if XRP is centralized and is pretty hated here. I am 100% on their side and hope that they show the SEC that they can't just do whatever they want.," As we all know XRP is the flagship of centralized Cryptocurrency. They are also one of the first ones being centralized and with that do not exactly mirror what Crypto should have been according to Satoshi Nakamoto. They may also have a high amount of whales which makes it quite manipulative. But still I love them right now as they are the ones standing up against the SEC.

The Ripple-SEC lawsuit probably has been a defining moment of Crypto. It was one of the first attempts by the SEC to just shut Crypto off and make the whole world leave it. That obviously did not go as they planned IT. XRP actually stood up against them and continues that lawsuit for like four years now.

It's very likely that this lawsuit concludes this year maybe even in summer as many lawyers said. In that case that may be the most important upcoming Crypto event. Ripple has secured many wins throughout the lawsuit already clearing up how corrupt they are but still a win would make it clear to the whole public.",197,1647280244.0,2022-03-14
If XRP/ Ripple can defeat the SEC it'll benefit whatever you hold.,"This may seem obvious, but this is by far the longest drawn out legal battle in the space, Ripple is one of the large players in this space (capital) money wise. This explains why the SEC have been unable to simply threaten them and get them to settle for an undisclosed amount.

So far this looks good for crypto because it shows us that the space won't simply vanish because of a few powerful people wanting to control or to get rid of it. Gary Gensler has gone unhinged and attacked many other crypto companies as well, this looks a lot like frustration.

It's like Ripple and XRP are this fortress that they know they need to conquer because then the others will be much easier. They've been stalemated for years now and it's beginning to become quite a circus, especially with the space just growing and growing even through a supposedly upcoming recession. Hold strong people, Gary will be meme material in the coming decade and the space still very much alive and unconquered.",100,1680250575.0,2023-03-31

"[SERIOUS] XRP Won, Grayscale Won: Who's Next? Coinbase and Binance?","XRP and Grayscale have both won their quests to get their products approved by the SEC. First, XRP won its lawsuit against the SEC, and now Grayscale won a court ruling to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

A three-judge appeals panel vacated a decision by the SEC that blocked the ETF, ruling that the SEC had failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two BTC futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed BTC ETP.

Exact words:

>The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale’s proposed bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale’s petition for review and vacate the Commission’s order.

And the victories of XRP and Grayscale are a major setback for the SEC, which has been criticized for its slow and cautious approach to cryptocurrency regulation. The SEC has been hesitant to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, arguing that they could be susceptible to fraud and manipulation. However, the appeals panel found that the SEC had not provided any evidence to support this claim.

Grayscale has said that it is actively reviewing the details outlined in the Court's opinion and will be pursuing next steps with the SEC as the SEC has not yet replied on the decision. It remains to be seen whether the SEC will approve Grayscale's Bitcoin ETP or be a crybaby again and appeal the ruling.

This is really big, and it could lead to more investment in the market by large entities. The ruling could also prompt other regulators to take a closer look at the cryptocurrency market, and soon we might have proper rules and regulations. It's a major win for Grayscale and for the industry as a whole and could pave the way for spot bitcoin ETFs to be approved by the SEC.

Now, after XRP and Grayscale won their respective cases against the SEC, it's now Coinbase's turn to show the SEC's bias against cryptocurrency. Sooner or later, Gary is going to get sacked, it's personal now.

**After Effects:**

* **Coinbase share price rose 15%**
* **Grayscale Bitcoin Trust soared 17%**
* **Bitcoin gained 6%**
* **Total Crypto Market Cap 6%**
* **Altcoins Market Cap 3.7%**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** XRP won its lawsuit against the SEC, and Grayscale won a court ruling that could pave the way for its Bitcoin ETP to be approved.",51,1693330446.0,2023-08-29
I hold XRP out of respect because they're taking it for the team...,"XRP Ripple is slugging it out in court, they could have settled to the EVIL EMPIRE (THE USA) but they didn't. They held their ground because the FEDs were being bullies and really haven't established a firm definition on crypto and seemed to use definitions on a whim. 

Ripple is a real-time macro settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network created by Ripple Labs Inc., a US-based technology company. Released in 2012, Ripple is built upon a distributed open source protocol, and supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities, or other units of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes. Ripple purports to enable ""secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks."" The ledger employs the native cryptocurrency known as XRP.

In December 2020, Ripple Labs and two of its executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for selling XRP tokens, which the SEC classified as unregistered securities.

However, it was evident in the trial that XRP told Ripple earlier (court document revealed) that they weren't a security.

I am baffled why the judge has not thrown out this case. However, there are rumours that XRP might settle.

The devil is in the details. XRP Ripple has signaled that they wil be hiring several hundreds of people. A JP Morgan report sent to investors earlier this month put XRP and the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit under the spotlight and concluded that a win would put the crypto asset on the road to mainstream adoption. More on that, here.

Coinbase, which was mentioned as a key player for XRP adoption, announced it will participate in the forum and will be represented by CEO Brian Armstrong and Lead Independent Director Fred Wilson. 

Ripple has successfully accelerated its global expansion this year despite fears that the lawsuit could cause hesitancy among institutional partners. Now it seems that the blockchain firm will be hiring a few hundreds in 2022 as they prepare the launch of the upcoming Liquidity Hub.

On top of that, the XRP Ledger has just had a “game-changer” upgrade that took a year to come into effect and it’s likely to strengthen its appeal. Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz said it was “awesome news”.

"Buzz around that the U.S. government could theoretically benefit from buying XRP at $10,000/coin. Can it happen?","
Lately all over social media, Again the buzz has been going around as follows: 

The U.S. government could theoretically benefit from buying XRP at $10,000 per token for several reasons, as outlined in speculative theories. 

Global Financial Dominance: By acquiring XRP and pegging its price at $10,000, the U.S. could establish XRP as a global reserve asset. This would allow the U.S. to maintain influence over international financial systems even in a post-dollar era.

Market Stability and Manipulation Prevention: A fixed price for XRP would reduce the risk of market manipulation by foreign powers like China. Even large-scale dumps of XRP would not affect its value below the benchmark price, safeguarding the financial system from potential economic warfare.

Blockchain Driven Economy: XRP’s use in instant settlements and tokenized assets could support a blockchain-based financial ecosystem. This would modernize the economy and facilitate transactions at a massive scale.

Leverage Through Treasury Bills (T-Bills): Instead of paying cash, the government could use T-Bills for the purchase, which Ripple could hold as reserves, collateral, or sell for liquidity. This approach strengthens the U.S. dollar’s relevance while transitioning to a blockchain-based economy.

Setting a Global Standard: A fixed XRP price endorsed by institutions like the IMF or Federal Reserve could force other nations to adopt this valuation or risk being excluded from global financial markets.

Arguments of XRP reaching astronomical amounts been buzzing around again and now over speculations of the Gov. swapping Tbills for Ripple's escrow triggering astronomical price growth...

So Why again does this happen time and again? Speculation (and also white paper research) done on XRP reaching into the thousands???

A similar thing happened to XRP, when Ripple was sued by the SEC on December 22, 2020, because XRP was alleged to be a security. XRP instantly started crashing and went down 67% in a week! A much more severe reaction. Everyone panicked and thought it was over. Many people capitulated.

.. but it was not the end. A week after the lawsuit started, XRP hit the price of $0.17. That was the ultimate buying moment. From that point, XRP did about a 11x to $1.96 in 15 weeks! Also, the $0.17 price was not seen again.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.

32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography.

"Ripple will deploy 200 million new XRP on the market this month; a dive into XRPs supply inflation | Every month, 1 billion XRPs become available for Ripple spending and can impact the market","*\*this report was* [*originally posted*](https://portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br/como-funciona-o-processo-que-vai-colocar-novos-r-460-milhoes-em-xrp-no-mercado-este-mes/) *on* ***Portal do Bitcoin*** *(in Portuguese-BR).*

Ripple, the company responsible for the XRP cryptocurrency, unlocked one billion units in July and, of that total, kept 200 million for itself. The amount can be put into circulation at any time and this inflationary process is repeated every month, which may impact the price and investments in the asset.

These XRPs held by Ripple in July amounts to around $94 million, at the time of writing, and the company has absolute freedom to use (or sell) these crypto assets as it sees fit.

In the case of selling, the amount represents more than 10% of the average daily trading volume of XRP on the market, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/) — which could impact its price.

Analysing [Binance’s order book](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/XRP_USDT?theme=dark&type=spot), responsible for the highest liquidity of XRP in the market, 200 million would be enough to completely clear all buy orders on all available spot pairs this Sunday (9).

This event, which can create strong selling pressure, is repeated every month and will continue like this for at least the next four years.

I’ve delved into XRP’s supply inflation system to understand and explain how these monthly releases works.

## How XRP supply inflation works

When XRP was created in 2012, the currency's ledger programmed a maximum of 100 billion units. Of which 20 billion was initially distributed between its creators and the core team behind the project.

80 billion came under the control of Ripple's treasury, which promised not to use the entire available supply at once, but to spend these coins gradually. In 2017, the team decided to [implement](https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-escrows-55-billion-xrp-for-supply-predictability/) a new system, aiming to provide more predictability in increasing the circulating supply (which moves from the Treasury Accounts to the market).

The [escrow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrow.asp) system was implemented. It is a type of [smart contract](https://ripple.com/insights/explanation-ripples-xrp-escrow/) that locks XRPs, making their use impossible, to be unlocked under some previously programmed conditions.

Ripple’s condition was to unlock one billion XRP on the first day of each month of each subsequent month, for a total of 55 months — or 55 billion XRP that still remained to be put into circulation.

However, even with a monthly release of a billion, not all of it was spent or sold by the company. In this way, Ripple began to lock in the remaining amount monthly, in new escrow contracts for the future. Extending the 55-month deadline for all XRPs to be released.

According to Messari, the XRP circulating supply has already increased by 8% in the last 12 months. Resulting in an approximate annual inflation in this value. There are currently 52.25 billion XRP circulating in the market.

## Where are the 1 billion XRP unlocked in July?

Following the onchain trails of Ripple's latest escrow release, I’ve found that out of the total 1 billion XRP, 800 million were rescheduled to be unlocked within \~3,5 years.

100 million adds to the previous 900 million for release on December 1, 2026; while 700 million started a new escrow that will only be unlocked on the first day of 2027.

Still, Ripple kept 200 million liquid XRP for this month.

https://preview.redd.it/habpwgudqxab1.png?width=2008&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f794b5ce21eb214bdab0fbcc14f5180f09d7b9c

In the cash flow graph, one billion XRP were unlocked (by escrow) on July 1, 2023. Split into five transactions, destined for two wallet addresses controlled by Ripple: [Ripple (22)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rp6aTJmW3nq1aKt3Jmuz4DPRxksT5PBjpH) and [Ripple (23)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rsjFB8mPWqiZgPUaVh8XYqdfa59PE2d5LG).

Each address received 500 million XRP. The Ripple (23) address forwarded everything to another address controlled by the company, [Ripple (10)](https://xrpscan.com/account/r9UUEXn3cx2seufBkDa8F86usfjWM6HiYp), which total value was fully locked in the new escrow for January 1, 2027.

The 500 million XRP received by Ripple (22) were split into two new transactions:

* 200 million sent to [Ripple (1)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rBg2FuZT91C52Nny68houguJ4vt5x1o91m), which remain liquid and available for use by Ripple;
* 300 million sent to [Ripple (11)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rB3WNZc45gxzW31zxfXdkx8HusAhoqscPn), which was again split and locked into two different escrows. One expiring on December 1, 2026 (100 million XRP); and another on January 1, 2027 (200 million XRP).

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the FOUR YEAR REPORT for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,** and **Stellar.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting every single month for four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the [2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/). ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.
* **December** **Highlights:** A bloody, all-red month
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** solidly in the lead, followed by **BTC** and **ADA.**  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, ***the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&P 500*** over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?
* A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (**fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).

1. I'll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)
2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. 
3. Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).
4. Giveaways: Who doesn’t love a good old fashioned giveaway? I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.
5. Friendly competition: I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP r/TotalCryptoMarketCap) to see which one outperforms.

## Four Year Report – UP 34%

https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=380248b14486edaa5749fba7a390198bf81260a0

Welcome to the four year report!

The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,** and **Stellar**.  

December highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **100% red month**. **IOTA** falls the least, only down -4% (on news that staking on the Firefly wallet will yield two cryptos, Assembly and Shimmer).
* **ETH** maintains a solid overall lead, **BTC** in second place, **ADA** in third.  Three coins in the green since January 2018.
* After four years, the 2018 Portfolio is +34%, behind the S&P 500’s ROI over the same time period.

## December Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2eadc9a98ec75b726cef37af7cb716fddf3126db

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** After four years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Tether**, **DOT, SOL**, **LUNA**, and **USDC.  NEM** looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.

## December Winners and Losers

***December Winners*** –  **IOTA** outperformed the pack, dropping only -4% this month. 100% of the cryptos in the red.

***December Losers*** –   Losing nearly a third of its value, **Litecoin** fell the most, down -30%. **NEM** followed **LTC**, dropping -27% in December.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After four years, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59

With 11, **Bitcoin** has two more monthly wins than second place **Cardano**.  **NEM** has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).

**Bitcoin** is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).

## Overall Update –  2021 ends with a whimper. After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in [October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.  After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: **BTC,** **ETH,** and **ADA.**

Overall, first place **ETH** (+413%) is well ahead of **BTC** (+257%) and third place **ADA** (+99%).

The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** four years ago?  It’s worth $515 today.

**DASH** and **NEM** are virtually tied at the bottom, both down over -86% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**  The initial $100 invested in each four ago is worth about $13 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=d82435bc0e39657707f2143fb5dd1951f6ddcfd1

End of December 2021 market cap: **$2,211,626,655,207**

The total crypto market dropped significantly in December.  Crypto as a sector is still up +285% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for **Ethereum)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=567958cf7214839fa7befa749d61125dade6a9a8

**BitDom** declined a bit in December, ending the month at 40.2%.  When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame, **BTC** dominance is near the low end.  For context:   

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25b3da0034194812e2b66f977450fff1555b48fb

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $325 in December.

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,341**, up 34% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.  Over the first four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.  And all ten of the green months have come in 2021. 

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:

https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6

The all time high for this portfolio is [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).   

Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the ***2019***, ***2020,*** and ***2021*** Top Ten Cryptos as well (***(and, just announced,*** [***again in 2022***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!)***.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48): up +34% (total value $1,341)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36) up +504% (total value $6,044)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24): up +795% (total value $8,951)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +292% (total value $3,921)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,257** ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).

**That’s up +406%** on the combined portfolios, **down from** [**last month’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47) for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2cd4923360a5492259faf606b3649c893fd4b16

***That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  

https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e68ae4c88a82ff35b70538ec11dd137e83447e2

After four years: the S&P 500 is up +78% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1,780 had it been redirected to the S&P.  That’s more than double the +34% return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio over the same period of time.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430** ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270)

That is up **+61%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+406%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

Here’s a fancy new chart showing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

## Conclusion:

Many thanks to the long-time Experiment followers, appreciate you taking the time to follow along over the years.  For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow give you a taste of what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and try to enjoy the ride! Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for monthly progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects where I repeat the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of [January 1st, 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36), [January 1st, 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24), [January 1st, 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12), and most recently, [January 1st, 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/).",6953,1642083108.0,2022-01-13

I have a good amount of confidence things will continue to grow after tomorrow but you never know and I don’t want to be buying bitcoin at $105k just to watch it correct back down to $75k in a couple weeks. I’m kind of at a loss for what to do with it. I like coins that I understand and ideally have some utility or logic based reason they will go up over time (XRP utility, BTC strategic reserves etc). I don’t really touch meme coins at all. 

Any ideas on options that are not at an all time high or have some compelling reason to grow beyond where they’re at now? Anything you guys think is currently undervalued? Doesn’t need to go up 3x next week as long as it doesn’t go down. ",0,1737306079.0,2025-01-19
Congrats to anyone who (like me) hodled XRP for the past 3-4 years!,"In early January 2018, I was persuaded to fomo into XRP, promised it'd make me one day rich...

Little did I know what I was about to get into, or that I was about to throw huge chunks of money too close to this shitcoin's ATH.

The following 3-4 years became all about hodling and pretty much accepting that my money was as good as lost, and that was fine, seeing as I knew the risks involved.

Today, for the first time since that trade first went into negative figures, I am seeing it turn green again, and I wanted to congratulate anyone else who like me has had the patience and endurance of hodling similar shitcoins for so long.

Never give up guys, and have a great day!

EDIT: I'm blown away by the amount of toxicity this post has received. Just to clarify a few things: I am NOT new to crypto and XRP was merely my first ever investment back in 2018, and now makes up a tiny percentage of my portfolio.

Regardless, some of the arrogance being displayed by some of these self-proclaimed ""experienced"" traders/investors towards anyone they deem to be new to crypto, is one of the main recurring issues I keep on coming across in this sub. Honestly, what is the point?

And, if you're new around here, don't let any of these kinds of comments disrupt your financial plans or your spirits towards the crypto community. Most people are actually very welcoming and helpful.",244,1618042225.0,2021-04-10

"Once XRP/ETH is declared a security, the entire crypto bubble is going to burst","Howey Test determines what qualifies as an ""investment contract"" and would therefore be subject to U.S. securities laws.

99% of coins shilled on this sub passes the Howy test as defined below:

1. An investment of money
2. In a common enterprise
3. With the expectation of profit
4. To be derived from the efforts of others

Certain cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) may be found to meet the definition of an ""investment contract"" under the test, especially ETH and XRP.

ETH ICO was conducted by a small group of centralised heads, VC investors, developers, as with any private company (therefore not decentralised) and carried out in Switzerland to circumvent SEC regulations. 

Now that ETH has gone PoS and has locked up billions of dollars worth of tokens for “staking”, we have a particularly odd situation where only a couple developers have the power to write the code to return the locked up funds back to retail investors. This is no different to an investment contract applied to any regulated publicly traded company.

BTC is the only cryptocurrency that is universally agreed upon (by regulators SEC and CFTC) to be a commodity. That is all. 

https://www.devere-group.com/sec-confirms-bitcoin-is-a-commodity-three-key-takeaways-for-crypto-investors/

Therefore everything else will eventually be scrutinised as a security thus the likes of Ripple, Cardano and ETH foundation will have to go public with *full* financial disclosures.

You can bet on all potential investors evaporating immediately once this happens and all the alts in the space will fall like dominoes.

I’m well aware my take will get obliterated by downvotes but if you think the SEC will continue to let things go as they are without clamping down on Securities Trading then you my friends are absolutely deluded bag holders.",0,1671275655.0,2022-12-17
Can anyone inform us what the point of XRP is now?,"If you dig far enough back in to my post history you'll see that I was active in the XRP subreddit. I'm not here to pick fights or argue with people. At the time, my thought process was, ""Ok, they have people lobbying in congress to make friendly regulation for crypto-remittances via banks. This seems cool. And I don't like having to make a 50 USD copay to send 100 USD to another country. This seems logical.""          

When I see a product like Strike where remittances are possible on bitcoin with lightning (albeit presently only to and from the US, and to and from El Salvador, to and from Argentina, and within all of these regions), I see something that is arguably a working product, or at least a product in development that seems to work.               

A long time ago I made a post that said basically something like, ""Bitcoin on lightning has just done what XRP on Xrapid wants to do without the need to go through a bank.""

Measuring from the top of the head to the neckline, the measured move down appears to be to $1.07. There is a candle wick that goes below the neckline, but the actual candle is well above it.

XRP - let me get this straight?! (Rant),"So, let me get this straight, XRP has been releasing 1 billion XRP from escrow accounts, every month, for the entire bear market.

They used this to dump on investors and used the money to build Ripple, the physical company.

Then, after most of this original community and investors capitulate, they announce a buyback, times with a BTC rally and they pump the price, causing another retail FOMO and gains of like 100% in a week.

How the fuck is this legal?
Btw, full disclosure, I have XRP holdings and I am in profit, even though it's a total shitcoin, I knew it would pump. The number go up was obvious, so despite my distaste for XRP, I like making money. So this post doesn't come from some angry XRP Army moron who capitulated last month.

UPDATE: Good News! XRP/SEC Update...,"Good piece of recent news added to the SEC WEBSITE.

As of March 18, 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has published several recent documents related to XRP: 1. Comprehensive Proposal: XRP as a Strategic Financial Asset for the U.S. (March 12, 2025): This proposal suggests measures to integrate XRP into the U.S. financial system, including mandates for banks to adopt XRP for liquidity solutions and a Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) mandate for XRP usage. The proposal aims to accelerate banking adoption by overriding resistance and allowing banks to use XRP immediately for Nostro account replacement. ￼ 2. NYSE Arca’s Proposal to List and Trade Shares of the Grayscale XRP Trust (February 14, 2025): NYSE Arca filed a proposal to list and trade shares of the Grayscale XRP Trust, an investment fund aiming to provide investors with exposure to XRP without the complexities of purchasing the asset directly. The Trust holds approximately $16.1 million in assets under management as of January 22, 2025. ￼ 3. Registration Statements for XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Several companies have filed registration statements with the SEC to launch XRP-focused ETFs: • CoinShares XRP ETF: An exchange-traded fund issuing shares representing units of XRP, providing investors with exposure to XRP’s price movements. ￼ • WisdomTree XRP Fund: An ETF that will list on the Cboe BZX Exchange, aiming to offer investors a cost-effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to XRP. ￼ • 21Shares Core XRP Trust: An ETF issuing shares that trade on the exchange, designed to track the performance of XRP. ￼",1,1742333628.0,2025-03-18

Why are XRP and XLM on a tear lately?,"Maybe its due to the ""banking crisis"" or maybe its wishful thinking that the SEC will lose its case against Ripple. Maybe its both.

XRP is up 16% in the last 7 days and XLM is up 20%. What hype is driving this run in the midsts of the bear market? Let's learn a little about both projects first.

In the world of crypto currency that aims to improve if not replace banking transactions for the average human things like XRP and XLM provide improvements in remittance and asset tokenization. For example XRP's, five main applications of the XRP Ledger are payments, tokenization, DeFi, CBDCs and stablecoins.  What is important is this. They claim that using their ledger include its low-cost ($0.0002 to transact), speed (settling transactions in 3-5 seconds), scalability (1,500 transactions per second) and inherently green attributes (carbon-neutral and energy-efficient). XLM is very similar and rides on XRP's co tail so whatever happens to Ripple may bring success or failure to the Stellar Foundation. This is not changing anytime soon. XLM goes as XRP goes. 

Now that you know a little about XRP you also know about XLM but what about number going up?  Is it all mere speculation on the fact that Ripple will defeat the SEC in its lawsuit or is it because the banking crisis is providing a legitimate use case to both projects as it comes to remittances, payments and banking efficiency and transparency. I honestly do not have the answer so I came to this sub to find out some opinions and thoughts. 

What I do know is that if the SEC loses to Ripple then XRP might go parabolic as the entire US market will then have access to it. News flash. Coinbase has announced re listing XRP in the near future. This could be bullish AF for Ripple but its all TBD. Where do you think all this goes?

Ripple is funding propaganda against Bitcoin by teaming up with the government to spread energy FUD,"Ripple labs has been funding ""research"" along with government entities to spread propaganda against Bitcoin and mining. 

In 2021, they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in New York has increased by $6 per month because of mining. 

[Claim: Mining drives up household electricity bills](https://preview.redd.it/m0ta2tae4xb81.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=8079d16b0fde7bc74ebd204d4362ff823da26d3f)

Surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices, but mining? 

[Since June 2020, Natural gas prices have gone up by 350&#37; in the USA \(Henry Hub natural gas futures rolling contracts\)](https://preview.redd.it/iprxvhfj5xb81.jpg?width=2610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4da2516b82eb585706d4d1af417320b5b82889e)

Surely, electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation, or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs.. but is due to bitcoin mining?!

Crude oil WTI futures are currently at 84, for comparison it was around 56 in Nov 2019 (pre pandemic). The last time WTI was above 80 was all the way back in 2014. Increasing crude oil natural gas prices, along with inflation that is at multi-decade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity, but its bitcoin mining that is responsible.. 

[Thats according to this study funded by Ripple in collusion with the Department of Treasury. ](https://preview.redd.it/a4z5aqnyaxb81.jpg?width=1944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6656489541bece07a0e9b83837d42345157f987c)... The same Department of Treasury headed by another well known Bitcoin hater Janet Yellen, who earned $7m as ""speaking fee"" from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle Bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity. 

Research with ""financial support"" is nothing but propaganda, especially when it's funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government. Ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders. 

Ripple has also cozied up with the likes of WEF, the very organisations Bitcoin was created as a fuck you to. [https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple)

As its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated, Ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up. As usual, they will fail. 

The narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in NY is rubbish, as the largest BTC mining companies in New York produce their own energy. Infact the last one to start mining in NY is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years, before they started mining Bitcoin last year. 

[https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php)

The other large mining company Greenidge Generation also produces its own energy.


Edit: Buttcoin losers in comments say ""reee bitcoin move to POS or govt will ban it""

Yeah not too bright, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button.

Another one who is literally a war monger calling for Ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global e-waste. Lmao. Bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch


Edit: Ripple shills keep brigading and claiming where is the paper, of course if you are as bricked as a ripple fan boy you need to be spoon fed everything. Well here is the paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779720

And if you open up the first page of it, says

> **Benetton and Compiani acknowledge financial support from Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative.**

i.e this whole ""paper"" is nothing but a hit piece propaganda sponsored by a competitor

The other writer of this paper is Adiar Morse, who conveniently works for the Dept of Treasury under Yellen: 

https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/prof-adair-morse-joins-biden-administration-as-a-treasury-department-deputy/

Seems like natural career progression - collect funds from Ripple to publish propaganda against Bitcoin, and get hired by Yellen who has been promoting propaganda against crypto for years now. Nothing to see here.

Final Edit: Jjust look at the number of freshly created ""Tin"" accounts that have popped up in the comments to shill for XRP. Didnt realize 2017 left so many bag holders. It must be real miserable with these heavy bags that are at 1/3rd of their 2017 ATH, while almost every other coin has gone up hundreds of % and made new highs this cycle. Thats what happens when you become exit liquidity for mccaleb, garlinghouse etc. 

Lol at the shills shouting ""REEE ripple is a company XRP is decentralised token"". They really did you good with this one small trick. 
Thats also the reason garlinhouse drives a shiny car while you are down 50% on your shitcoin investment.
